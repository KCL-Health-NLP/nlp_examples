Chronic cholecystitis.\n\n\nNAME OF OPERATION: \n Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n\nANESTHESIA:\n  General.\n\n\nFINDINGS:\n  The gallbladder was thickened and showed evidence of chronic cholecystitis.  There was a great deal of inflammatory reaction around the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was slightly larger.  There was a stone impacted in the cystic duct with the gallbladder.  The gallbladder contained numerous stones which were small.  With the stone impacted in the cystic duct, it was felt that probably none were within the common duct.  Other than rather marked obesity, no other significant findings were noted on limited exploration of the abdomen.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:\n  Under general anesthesia after routine prepping and draping, the abdomen was insufflated with the Veress needle, and the standard four trocars were inserted uneventfully.  Inspection was made for any entry problems, and none were encountered.\n\nAfter limited exploration, the gallbladder was then retracted superiorly and laterally, and the cystic duct was dissected out.  This was done with some difficulty due to the fibrosis around the cystic duct, but care was taken to avoid injury to the duct and to the common duct.  In this manner, the cystic duct and cystic artery were dissected out.  Care was taken to be sure that the duct that was identified went into the gallbladder and was the cystic duct.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were then doubly clipped and divided, taking care to avoid injury to the common duct.  The gallbladder was then dissected free from the gallbladder bed.  Again, the gallbladder was somewhat adherent to the gallbladder bed due to previous inflammatory reaction.  The gallbladder was dissected free from the gallbladder bed utilizing the endo shears and the cautery to control bleeding.  The gallbladder was extracted through the operating trocar site, and the trocar was reinserted.  Inspection was made of the gallbladder bed.  One or two bleeding areas were fulgurated, and bleeding was well controlled.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[286, 297, "ANATOMY"], [418, 429, "ANATOMY"], [436, 447, "ANATOMY"], [504, 515, "ANATOMY"], [525, 536, "ANATOMY"], [543, 554, "ANATOMY"], [631, 642, "ANATOMY"], [698, 702, "ANATOMY"], [1109, 1120, "ANATOMY"], [1174, 1185, "ANATOMY"], [1272, 1283, "ANATOMY"], [1327, 1331, "ANATOMY"], [1350, 1354, "ANATOMY"], [1377, 1388, "ANATOMY"], [1393, 1406, "ANATOMY"], [1463, 1467, "ANATOMY"], [1502, 1513, "ANATOMY"], [1526, 1537, "ANATOMY"], [1544, 1555, "ANATOMY"], [1560, 1573, "ANATOMY"], [1654, 1658, "ANATOMY"], [1665, 1676, "ANATOMY"], [1710, 1721, "ANATOMY"], [1739, 1750, "ANATOMY"], [1780, 1791, "ANATOMY"], [1840, 1851, "ANATOMY"], [1880, 1891, "ANATOMY"], [1964, 1975, "ANATOMY"], [2084, 2095, "ANATOMY"], [72, 86, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [92, 113, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [147, 161, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [167, 188, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [335, 356, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [730, 737, "DISEASESYNDROME"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nEXAM:\n  Ultrasound-guided paracentesis\n\n\nHISTORY: \n Ascites.\n\n\nTECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  \nInformed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were thoroughly explained.

He has had previous colonoscopy.  There is no family history of bleeding, no current problems with his bowels.  On examination, he has internal hemorrhoids.  His prostate is enlarged and increased somewhat in firmness.  He has scattered diverticular disease of a moderate degree and he has two polyps, one 1 cm in the mid ascending colon, and one in the left transverse colon, which is also 1 cm.  These were removed with snare polypectomy technique.  I would recommend that the patient have an increased fiber diet and repeat colonoscopy in 5 years or sooner if he develops bowel habit change or bleeding.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n After explaining the operative procedure, the risks and potential complications of bleeding and perforation, the patient was given 175 mcg fentanyl, and 8 mg Versed intravenously for conscious sedation.  Blood pressure 115/60, pulse 98, respiration 18, and saturation 92%.  A rectal examination was done and then the colonoscope was inserted through the anorectum, rectosigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon, to the ileocecal valve.  The scope was withdrawn to the mid ascending colon, where the polyp was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, then retrieved through the suction port.  The scope was withdrawn into the left transverse colon, where the second polyp was identified.  It was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, and then removed through the suction port as well.

She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain.  She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes.  She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same.\n\n\nOPERATIVE COURSE:  \n The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail.  She provided her consent.  The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl.  A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure.  This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided.  In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure.  While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse.  In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk.  For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure.  She was noted to have some pools of stool.  This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes.  Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself.  It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum.  However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome.  The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home.\n\n\nPLAN:\n  She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures.  She has been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum.  She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic.  Lastly, it should be noted that when she next undergoes endoscopic procedure, propofol would be indicated.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[562, 566, "ANATOMY"], [1105, 1109, "ANATOMY"], [2043, 2048, "ANATOMY"], [2180, 2185, "ANATOMY"], [2739, 2745, "ANATOMY"], [69, 99, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [132, 162, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [917, 926, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2324, 2339, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [401, 422, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [427, 441, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1223, 1233, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1322, 1326, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2217, 2227, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROCEDURES PERFORMED:\n  Colonoscopy.\n\n\nINDICATIONS:\n  Renewed symptoms likely consistent with active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, not responsive to conventional therapy including sulfasalazine, cortisone, local therapy.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure with special attention to benefits, risks, alternatives.

Her past history, her past workup, her past visitation with me for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, well responsive to sulfasalazine reviewed.  She currently has a flare and is not responding, therefore, likely may require steroid taper.  At the same token, her symptoms are mild.  She has rectal bleeding, essentially only some rusty stools.  There is not significant diarrhea, just some lower stools.  No significant pain.  Therefore, it is possible that we are just dealing with a hemorrhoidal bleed, therefore, colonoscopy now needed.  Past history reviewed.  Specifics of workup, need for followup, and similar discussed.  All questions answered.\n\nA normal digital rectal examination was performed.  The PCF-160 AL was inserted into the anus and advanced to the cecum without difficulty, as identified by the ileocecal valve, cecal stump, and appendical orifice.  All mucosal aspects thoroughly inspected, including a retroflexed examination.  Withdrawal time was greater than six minutes.  Unfortunately, the terminal ileum could not be intubated despite multiple attempts.\n\nFindings were those of a normal cecum, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon.  A small cecal polyp was noted, this was biopsy-removed, placed in bottle #1.  Random biopsies from the cecum obtained, bottle #2; random biopsies from the transverse colon obtained, as well as descending colon obtained, bottle #3.  There was an area of inflammation in the proximal sigmoid colon, which was biopsied, placed in bottle #4.  There was an area of relative sparing, with normal sigmoid lining, placed in bottle #5, randomly biopsied, and then inflammation again in the distal sigmoid colon and rectum biopsied, bottle #6, suggesting that we may be dealing with Crohn disease, given the relative sparing of the sigmoid colon and junk lesion.  Retroflexed showed hemorrhoidal disease.  Scope was then withdrawn, patient left in good condition.  \n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n  Active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, question of Crohn disease.\n\n\nPLAN: \n I will have the patient follow up with me, will follow up on histology, follow up on the polyps.

Samples were obtained from the antrum and prepyloric area to check for Helicobacter, rapid urease, and additional samples were sent to pathology.  Retroflexion view of the fundus of the stomach was normal without evidence of a hiatal hernia.  The scope was then slowly removed.  The distal esophagus appeared benign with a normal-appearing gastroesophageal sphincter and no esophagitis.  The remaining portion of the esophagus was normal.\n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n  Abdominal pain.  Symptoms most consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease without endoscopic evidence of hiatal hernia.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n  Await results of CLO testing and biopsies.

Father is alive, but unknown medical history as they have been estranged.  She has a 51-year-old sister with history of multiple colon polyps.  She has 2 brothers, 1 of whom has schizophrenia, but she knows very little about their medical history.  To the best of her knowledge, there are no family members with stomach cancer or colon cancer.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \n She was born in Houston, Texas and moved to Florida about 3 years ago.  She is divorced.  She has worked as a travel agent.  She has 2 sons ages 24 and 26, both of whom are alive and well.  She smokes a half a pack of cigarettes per day for more than 35 years.  She does not consume alcohol.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: \n As per the form filled out in our office today is positive for hypertension, weakness in arms and legs, arthritis, pneumonia, ankle swelling, getting full quickly after eating, loss of appetite, weight loss, which is stated as fluctuating up and down 4 pounds, trouble swallowing, heartburn, indigestion, belching, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, change in bowel habits, change in consistency, rectal bleeding, hemorrhoids, abdominal discomfort and cramping associated with constipation, hepatitis A or infectious hepatitis in the past, and smoking and alcohol as previously stated.  Otherwise, review of systems is negative for strokes, paralysis, gout, cataracts, glaucoma, respiratory difficulties, tuberculosis, chest pain, heart disease, kidney stones, hematuria, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, cancer, diabetes, thyroid disease, seizure disorder, blood transfusions, anemia, jaundice, or pruritus.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \nWeight 152 pounds.  Height is 5 feet 3 inches.  Blood pressure 136/80.  Pulse 68.  In general:  She is a well-developed and well-nourished female who ambulates with the assistance of a cane.  Neurologically nonfocal.  Awake, alert, and oriented x 3.  HEENT:  Head normocephalic, atraumatic.  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae are pink.  Mouth is moist without any obvious oral lesions.  Neck is supple.  There is no submandibular, submaxillary, axillary, supraclavicular, or epitrochlear adenopathy appreciable.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm without obvious gallops or murmurs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender with good bowel sounds.  No organomegaly or masses are appreciable.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, and/or edema.  Skin is warm and dry.  Rectal was deferred and will be done at the time of the colonoscopy.\n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.  A 50-year-old female whose 51-year-old sister has a history of multiple colon polyps, which may slightly increase her risk for colon cancer in the future.\n2.  Reports of recurrent bright red blood per rectum, mostly on the toilet paper over the past year.  Bleeding most likely consistent with internal hemorrhoids; however, she needs further evaluation for colon polyps or colon cancer.\n3.  Alternations between constipation and diarrhea for the past several years with some lower abdominal cramping and discomfort particularly associated with constipation.  She is on multiple medications including narcotics and may have developed narcotic bowel syndrome.\n4.  A long history of pyrosis, dyspepsia, nausea, and belching for many years relieved by antacids.  She may likely have underlying gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n5.  A 1-year history of some early satiety and fluctuations in her weight up and down 4 pounds.  She may also have some GI dysmotility including gastroparesis.\n6.  Report of dysphagia to solids over the past several years with a history of a bone spur in her cervical spine.  If this bone spur is pressing anteriorly, it could certainly cause recurrent symptoms of dysphagia.  Differential also includes peptic stricture or Schatzki's ring, and even remotely, the possibility of an esophageal malignancy.\n7.  A history of infectious hepatitis in the past with some recent mild elevations in AST and ALT levels without clear etiology.  She may have some reaction to her multiple medications including her statin drugs, which can cause mild elevations in transaminases.  She may have some underlying fatty liver disease and differential could include some form of viral hepatitis such as hepatitis B or even C.\n\n\nPLAN:\n\n1.  We have asked her to follow up with her primary care physician with regard to this recent elevation in her transaminases.  She will likely have the lab tests repeated in the future, and if they remain persistently elevated, we will be happy to see her in the future for further evaluation if her primary care physician would like.\n2.  Discussed reflux precautions and gave literature for further review.\n3.  Schedule an upper endoscopy with possible esophageal dilatation, as well as colonoscopy with possible infrared coagulation of suspected internal hemorrhoids.  Both procedures were explained in detail including risks and complications such as adverse reaction to medication, as well as respiratory embarrassment, infection, bleeding, perforation, and possibility of missing a small polyp or tumor.\n4.  Alternatives including upper GI series, flexible sigmoidoscopy, barium enema, and CT colonography were discussed; however, the patient agrees to proceed with the plan as outlined above.\n5.  Due to her sister's history of colon polyps, she will likely be advised to have a repeat colonoscopy in 5 years or perhaps sooner pending the results of her baseline examination.\n\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[549, 554, "ANATOMY"], [732, 739, "ANATOMY"], [750, 755, "ANATOMY"], [1197, 1201, "ANATOMY"], [2062, 2066, "ANATOMY"], [2542, 2547, "ANATOMY"], [2588, 2593, "ANATOMY"], [2694, 2699, "ANATOMY"], [2753, 2764, "ANATOMY"], [2995, 3000, "ANATOMY"], [3050, 3055, "ANATOMY"], [3124, 3130, "ANATOMY"], [3281, 3286, "ANATOMY"], [3297, 3302, "ANATOMY"], [3566, 3571, "ANATOMY"], [3989, 3993, "ANATOMY"], [4006, 4020, "ANATOMY"], [4031, 4035, "ANATOMY"], [5699, 5704, "ANATOMY"], [1162, 1174, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1203, 1212, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1214, 1223, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1510, 1521, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1587, 1596, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1602, 1612, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1728, 1735, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1748, 1752, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1765, 1773, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1801, 1813, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1857, 1866, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1868, 1883, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1908, 1916, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1918, 1933, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1973, 1979, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2517, 2527, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3217, 3237, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3572, 3580, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3714, 3737, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3892, 3905, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3921, 3930, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4112, 4121, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4171, 4186, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4229, 4239, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4269, 4279, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4545, 4556, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4609, 4624, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4633, 4642, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [5119, 5129, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [5213, 5233, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [5362, 5398, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [62, 69, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1176, 1184, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1380, 1389, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1391, 1402, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1404, 1412, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1414, 1420, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1422, 1430, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1432, 1444, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1446, 1468, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1523, 1543, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1548, 1556, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1573, 1585, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1775, 1799, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1815, 1825, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1935, 1942, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1981, 1989, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2777, 2785, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2787, 2795, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2804, 2809, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3336, 3348, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3353, 3361, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3405, 3423, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3428, 3438, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3468, 3480, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3604, 3611, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3613, 3622, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3624, 3630, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3636, 3644, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3776, 3789, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3794, 3806, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4100, 4108, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nCHIEF COMPLAINT: \n Nausea.\n\n\nPRESENT ILLNESS: \n The patient is a 28-year-old, who is status post gastric bypass surgery nearly one year ago.  He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back.  He feels like he was on it but has not done so.  He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3.  He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms.  His last normal bowel movement was yesterday.  He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: \n Significant for hypertension and morbid obesity, now resolved.\n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: \n Gastric bypass surgery in December 2007.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  \nMultivitamins and calcium.\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n None known.\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  \nPositive for diabetes mellitus in his father, who is now deceased.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \n He denies tobacco or alcohol.

He is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation.  He is oriented to person, place, and situation.  He is normocephalic, atraumatic.  His sclerae are anicteric.  His mucous membranes are somewhat tacky.  His neck is supple and symmetric.  His respirations are unlabored and clear.  He has a regular rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is soft.  He has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding.  He otherwise has no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias evident.  His extremities are symmetrical with no edema.  His posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric.  He is grossly nonfocal neurologically.\n\n\nSTUDIES:\n  His white blood cell count is 8.4 with 79 segs.  His hematocrit is 41.  His electrolytes are normal.  His bilirubin is 2.8.

The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.  Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody.  Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion.  He spent 3 days in the hospital.  He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient.  From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection.  At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nVITAL SIGNS:  Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area.\nHEENT:  PERRLA.  EOM intact.  Oropharynx is clear of lesions.\nNECK:  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\nABDOMEN:  Not tender, not distended.  Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin.  No hepatomegaly.  Bowel sounds present.\nMUSCULOSKELETAL:  No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema.\nNEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.  No asterixis.  No costovertebral tenderness.\nPSYCHE:  The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative.\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA: \n We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63.  His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53.  We do not have any other results back.  No hepatitis panels.  No alpha-fetoprotein level.  The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information.\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n  The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause.\n1.  Epigastric pain.  The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time.  In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam.  His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously.  He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician.\n2.  End-stage liver disease.  Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis.  We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before.  We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past.  Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X.  The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result.  It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time.\n\nWe are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level.  We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver.  We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B.  Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C.  The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also.  We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before.  PSC is extremely unlikely but possible.  Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.  Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem.  On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly.  We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low.  I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy.  We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy.  The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City.  We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that.\n\nAt this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily.  The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time.  I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him.  As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal.  The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills.  He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58.  The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication.  The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.\n\nAgain, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above.\n\nWe also discussed nutrition issues.  The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day.  He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve.  He also was advised to stay away from alcohol.  His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[1121, 1125, "ANATOMY"], [1157, 1162, "ANATOMY"], [1370, 1375, "ANATOMY"], [1571, 1577, "ANATOMY"], [1605, 1610, "ANATOMY"], [2879, 2895, "ANATOMY"], [5687, 5692, "ANATOMY"], [332, 337, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [949, 964, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1336, 1351, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2223, 2232, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2570, 2575, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3110, 3133, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3184, 3189, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3217, 3226, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3278, 3283, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3762, 3771, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3954, 3959, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3984, 3993, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4052, 4061, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4137, 4160, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4206, 4215, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4310, 4315, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4443, 4457, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4571, 4600, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4655, 4659, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4677, 4700, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4911, 4925, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4974, 4986, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [5123, 5130, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [5504, 5527, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [62, 69, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [213, 227, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [229, 235, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [237, 246, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [252, 260, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [695, 710, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [712, 720, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1008, 1023, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1025, 1031, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1043, 1048, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1054, 1060, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1226, 1230, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1648, 1656, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1661, 1669, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1674, 1687, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1716, 1725, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1746, 1756, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2606, 2621, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2640, 2652, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2801, 2815, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2839, 2843, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2925, 2939, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3002, 3006, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [5310, 5318, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Chronic cholecystitis without cholelithiasis.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  \nChronic cholecystitis without cholelithiasis.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION: \n The patient was brought to the operating room and anesthesia was induced.

Over the past year, this has caused him an increasing number of problems, including chest pain when he eats, and shortness of breath after large meals.  He is also having reflux symptoms again.  He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication.\n\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: \n Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure.  He was stable at that time.  He did complain of some nausea.  However, he did not have any vomiting at that time.  He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o.  He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol.  On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed.  Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows.  He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting.  Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications.  He ambulated frequently.  He remained n.p.o. for three days.  He also had the NG tube in during that time.  On postoperative day #4, he began to have some flatus, and the NG tube was discontinued.  He was advanced to a liquid diet and tolerated this without any complications.  At this time, he was still using the PCA for pain control.  However, he was using it much less frequently than on days #1 and #2 postoperatively.  After tolerating the full liquid diet without any complications, he was advanced to a soft diet and his pain medications were transitioned to p.o. medications rather than the PCA.  The PCA was discontinued.  He tolerated the soft diet without any complications and continued to have flatus frequently.  On postoperative day #6, it was determined that he was stable for discharge to home as he was taking p.o. without any complications.  His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain medications.  He was passing gas frequently, had excellent urine output, and was ambulating frequently without any issues.\n\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:\n  Stable.\n\n\nDISPOSITION: \n Discharged to home.\n\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: \n The patient was discharged to home with instructions for maintaining a soft diet.  It was also recommended that he does not drink any soda postoperatively.  He is instructed to keep his incision site clean and dry and it was also recommended that he avoid any heavy lifting.  He will be able to attend school when it starts in a few weeks.  However, he is not going to be able to play football in the near future.  He was given prescription for pain medication upon discharge.  He is instructed to contact Pediatric Surgery if he has any fevers, any nausea and vomiting, any chest pain, any constipation, or any other concerns.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[1907, 1910, "ANATOMY"], [2192, 2195, "ANATOMY"], [2202, 2205, "ANATOMY"], [66, 79, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [81, 104, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [146, 159, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [161, 184, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [226, 245, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [268, 281, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [591, 604, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [838, 851, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [691, 701, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [720, 739, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [785, 793, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1065, 1071, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1103, 1111, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1186, 1190, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1429, 1435, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1471, 1479, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1747, 1753, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1915, 1919, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2121, 2125, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2300, 2306, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2458, 2462, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2493, 2497, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3164, 3168, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3257, 3263, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3269, 3275, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3280, 3288, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3294, 3304, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3310, 3322, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.

Congenital heart disease.\n\n\nOPERATION PERFORMED: \n Gastrostomy.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General.\n\n\nINDICATIONS:  \nThis 6-week-old female infant had been transferred to Children's Hospital because of Down syndrome and congenital heart disease.  She has not been able to feed well and in fact has to now be NG tube fed.  Her swallowing mechanism does not appear to be very functional, and therefore, it was felt that in order to aid in her home care that she would be better served with a gastrostomy.\n\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  \nAfter the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in usual manner.  Transverse left upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The muscle was divided and the peritoneal cavity entered.  The greater curvature of the stomach was grasped with a Babcock clamp and brought into the operative field.  The site for gastrostomy was selected and a pursestring suture of #4-0 Nurolon placed in the gastric wall.  A 14-French 0.8 cm Mic-Key tubeless gastrostomy button was then placed into the stomach and the pursestring secured about the tube.  Following this, the stomach was returned to the abdominal cavity and the posterior fascia was closed using a #4-0 Nurolon affixing the stomach to the posterior fascia.  The anterior fascia was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue with the same, and the skin closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.  The balloon was inflated to the full 5 mL.  A sterile dressing was then applied and the child awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.\n\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[124, 129, "ANATOMY"], [223, 228, "ANATOMY"], [432, 437, "ANATOMY"], [1040, 1047, "ANATOMY"], [1213, 1225, "ANATOMY"], [1308, 1315, "ANATOMY"], [1381, 1388, "ANATOMY"], [1496, 1503, "ANATOMY"], [80, 88, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [94, 107, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [179, 187, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [193, 206, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [403, 416, "DISEASESYNDROME"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula).\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula).\n\n\nOPERATION PERFORMED: \n Surgical closure of gastrostomy.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General.\n\n\nINDICATIONS: \n This 1-year-old child had a gastrostomy placed due to feeding difficulties.  Since then, he has reached a point where he is now eating completely by mouth and no longer needed the gastrostomy.  The tube was, therefore, removed, but the tract has not shown signs of spontaneous closure.  He, therefore, comes to the operating room today for surgical closure of his gastrostomy.\n\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE: \n After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner.  An elliptical incision was made around the gastrostomy site and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The tract and the stomach were freed.  Stay sutures were then placed on either side of the tract.  The tract was amputated.  The intervening stomach was then closed with interrupted #4-0 Lembert, Nurolon sutures.  The fascia was then closed over the stomach using #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.

She had her pain controlled with p.o. pain medicine.  She was afebrile.  She is tolerating liquid diet.  It was felt that the patient is stable for discharge.  She did complain of bladder spasms when she urinated and she did say that she has a history of chronic UTIs.  We will check a UA and urine culture prior to discharge.  I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain.  Her labs were within normal limits.  She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related.  Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits.  Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed.  They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively.  I feel that she looks good for discharge.\n\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: \n Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower.  She needs to keep her wound clean and dry.  She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks.  No driving for 1 to 2 weeks.  She must be able to stop in an emergency and be off narcotic meds, no strenuous activity, but she needs to maintain mobility.  She can resume her medications per med rec sheets.\n\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: \n As previously mentioned.\n\n\nFOLLOWUP:\n  We will follow up on both urinalysis and cultures.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks.  She needs to call for any shortness of breath, temperature greater than 101.5, chest pain, intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, any redness, swelling or foul smelling drainage from her wounds.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[661, 668, "ANATOMY"], [78, 92, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [131, 145, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [221, 223, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [307, 321, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [744, 748, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1163, 1181, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1225, 1228, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1404, 1409, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [210, 217, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [493, 497, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [519, 523, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [986, 998, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1043, 1047, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1660, 1663, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2149, 2168, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2202, 2212, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2226, 2232, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2248, 2262, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\n  This is a 1-year-old male patient who was admitted on 12/23/2007 with a history of rectal bleeding.

The patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A periumbilical incision was made.  The fascia was incised.  Peritoneal cavity entered bluntly.  A 10-mm trocar and scope was passed.  Peritoneal cavity was insufflated.  Five-mm ports placed in left lower and hypogastric areas.  On visualization of the right lower quadrant, appendix was visualized stuck against the right anterior abdominal wall, there is obvious site of perforation and leakage of content and pus.  We proceeded to take the mesoappendix down to the base, and once the base was free, we placed GIA stapler across the base, fired the stapler, removed the appendix through the periumbilical port site.  We irrigated and suctioned out the right lower and pelvic areas.  We then removed the ports under direct visualization, closed the periumbilical port site fascia with 0 Vicryl, all skin incisions with 5-0 Monocryl, and dressed with Steri-Strips.  The patient was extubated in the operating table and taken back to recovery room.

The patient was found to have cholelithiasis on last admission.  He was being worked up for this including cardiac clearance.  However, in the interim, he returned again with another episode of same pain.  The patient had a HIDA scan done yesterday, which shows nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction.  Because of these, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was advised with cholangiogram.  Possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure was also explained to the patient.  The procedure, indications, risks, and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent was obtained.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: \n The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia.  The entire abdomen was prepped and draped.  A small transverse incision was made about 2-1/2 inches above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia.  The patient has a rather long torso.  Fascia was opened vertically and stay sutures were placed in the fascia.  Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.  Hasson cannula was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it was insufflated with CO2.  Laparoscopic camera was inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg and rotated to the left.  An 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.  Slowly, the dissection was carried out in the right subhepatic area.  Initially, I was able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver.  Then, some inflammatory changes were noted with some fatty necrosis type of changes and it was not quite clear whether this was part of the gallbladder or it was just pericholecystic infection/inflammation.  The visualization was extremely difficult because of the patient's obesity and a lot of fat intra-abdominally, although his abdominal wall is not that thick.  After evaluating this for a little while, we decided that there was no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy.  The trocars were removed.\n\nA right subcostal incision was made and peritoneal cavity was entered.  A Bookwalter retractor was put in place.  The dissection was then carried out on the undersurface of the liver.  Eventually, the gallbladder was identified, which was markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it.  Dissection was further carried down to what was felt to be the common bile duct, which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size.  The duodenum was kocherized.  The gallbladder was partly intrahepatic.  Because of this, I decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem.  The inferior wall of the gallbladder was opened and two large stones, one was about 3 cm long and another one about 1.5 x 2 cm long, were taken out of the gallbladder.\n\nIt was difficult to tell where the cystic duct was.  Eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder, I did find the cystic duct, which was relatively very short.  Intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done using C-arm fluoroscopy.  This showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone.  At this time, a decision was made to proceed with common duct exploration.  The common duct was opened between stay sutures of 4-0 Vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out.  After some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver, the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct.  So, it was about a 1-cm size stone, which was removed.  Following this, a 10-French red rubber catheter was passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously.  No further stones were obtained.  The catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater.  At this point, a choledochoscope was inserted and proximally, I did not see any evidence of any common duct stones or proximally into the biliary tree.  However, a stone was found distally still floating around.  This was removed with stone forceps.  The bile ducts were irrigated again.  No further stones were removed.  A 16-French T-tube was then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct was repaired around the T-tube using 4-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures obtaining watertight closure.  A completion T-tube cholangiogram was done at this time, which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct, although externally, I was unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area.  Because of this, the T-tube was removed, and I passed the choledochoscope proximally again, and I was unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area.  I felt at this time this was most likely an impression from the outside, which was still left over a gallbladder where the stone was stuck and it was impressing on the bile duct.  The bile duct lumen was widely open.  T-tube was again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion T-tube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time.  The cystic duct opening through which I had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram, this was closed with a figure-of-eight suture of 2-0 Vicryl, and this was actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this area.\n\nThe remaining gallbladder bed, which was left in situ, was cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining.  Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution.  Hemostasis was good.  A 10-mm Jackson-Pratt drain was left in the foramen of Winslow and brought out through the lateral 5-mm port site.  The T-tube was brought out through the middle 5-mm port site, which was just above the incision.  Abdominal incision was then closed in layers using 0 Vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and #1 Novafil running suture for the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 3-0 Vicryl running sutures in two layers.  Subfascial and subcutaneous tissues were injected with a total of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control.

Cholelithiasis.\n\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General.\n\n\nINDICATIONS: \n This is a 38-year-old diabetic Hispanic female patient, with ongoing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, associated with nausea.  Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient also had somewhat thickened gallbladder wall.  The patient was admitted through emergency room last night with acute onset right upper quadrant pain.  Clinically, it was felt the patient had acute cholecystitis.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram was advised.  Procedure, indication, risk, and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail preoperatively and informed consent was obtained.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: \n The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia, and abdomen was prepped and draped.  A small transverse incision was made just above the umbilicus under local anesthesia.  Fascia was opened vertically.  Stay sutures were placed in the fascia.  Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered.  Hasson cannula was inserted and peritoneal cavity was insufflated with CO2.\n\nLaparoscopic camera was inserted, and the patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg, rotated to the left.  A 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region.  Examination at this time showed no free fluid, no acute inflammatory changes.  Liver was grossly normal.  Gallbladder was noted to be thickened.  Gallbladder wall with a stone stuck in the neck of the gallbladder and pericholecystic edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis.\n\nThe fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly, and dissection was carried at the neck of the gallbladder where a cystic duct was identified and isolated.  It was clipped distally and using C-arm fluoroscopy, intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done, which was interpreted as normal.  There was slight dilatation noted at the junction of the right and left hepatic duct, but no filling defects or any other pathology was noted.  It was presumed that this was probably a congenital anomaly.  The cystic duct was clipped twice proximally and divided beyond the clips.  Cystic artery was identified, isolated, clipped twice proximally, once distally, and divided.\n\nThe gallbladder was then removed from its bed using cautery dissection and subsequently delivered through the umbilical port.  Specimen was sent for histopathology.  Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution.  Hemostasis was good.  Trocars were removed under direct vision and peritoneal cavity was evacuated with CO2.  Umbilical area fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures, required extra sutures to close the fascial defect.  Some difficulty was encountered closing the fascia initially because of the patient's significant amount of subcutaneous fat.  In the end, the repair appears to be quite satisfactory.  Rest of the incisions closed with 3-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues and staples for the skin.  Sterile dressing was applied.\n\nThe patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[533, 544, "ANATOMY"], [1673, 1684, "ANATOMY"], [1713, 1724, "ANATOMY"], [1768, 1779, "ANATOMY"], [1849, 1855, "ANATOMY"], [1863, 1874, "ANATOMY"], [1947, 1958, "ANATOMY"], [1967, 1978, "ANATOMY"], [2077, 2088, "ANATOMY"], [2214, 2231, "ANATOMY"], [2357, 2368, "ANATOMY"], [2429, 2442, "ANATOMY"], [2528, 2539, "ANATOMY"], [72, 86, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [92, 111, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [145, 175, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [181, 195, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [476, 490, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [696, 715, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1646, 1651, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1823, 1842, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [404, 429, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [447, 453, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [628, 653, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1800, 1805, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROCEDURE:\n  Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction.\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: \n A 92-year-old lady with history of dysphagia on and off for two years.  She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva.  This started almost a day earlier.  She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything.  She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5.\n\n\nOPERATIVE NOTE: \n Informed consent was obtained from patient.  The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed.  Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks.  Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg.  The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus.  There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus.  This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots.  The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation.  Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation.\n\nThe scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation.  Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net.  Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft.  Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out.  Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully.  The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy.  No active bleeding was seen.  There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach.  As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted.\n\n\nIMPRESSION: \n Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction.  Treated as described above.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n  IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h.  Clear liquid diet for 24 hours.  If the patient is stable, thereafter she may take soft pureed diet only until next endoscopy, which will be scheduled in three to four weeks.  She should take Prevacid SoluTab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[950, 959, "ANATOMY"], [1007, 1016, "ANATOMY"], [1043, 1052, "ANATOMY"], [1092, 1101, "ANATOMY"], [1397, 1406, "ANATOMY"], [1513, 1522, "ANATOMY"], [1754, 1761, "ANATOMY"], [1920, 1929, "ANATOMY"], [2137, 2144, "ANATOMY"], [171, 180, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1827, 1837, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2047, 2057, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2239, 2249, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [125, 132, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1959, 1974, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Acute appendicitis.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Acute appendicitis.\n\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:\n  Laparoscopic appendectomy.\n\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: \n Include inflamed, non-perforated appendix.\n\n\nOPERATIVE NOTE:  \nThe patient was seen by me in the preoperative holding area.  The risks of the procedure were explained.  She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery.  General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted.  The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion.  A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope.  Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum.  A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region.  The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized.  The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated.  I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix.  The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty.  I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.  I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry.  One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line.  We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites.  The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture.  The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  No complications.  Minimal blood loss.  Specimen is the appendix.

A Gore exclusive device was used 3 pieces were used to effect the repair.  We had to place an iliac extender down in to right external iliac artery to manage the right common iliac artery aneurysm.  The right hypogastric artery had been previously coiled off.  Left common femoral artery was used for the _____ side.  We had small type 2 leak right underneath the take off the renal arteries, this was not felt to be type I leak and this was very delayed filling and it was felt that this was highly indicative of type 2 leak from a lumbar artery, which commonly come off in this area.  It was felt that this would seal after reversal of the anticoagulation given sufficient time.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n With the patient supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.\n\nBilateral groin incisions were made, and the common femoral arteries were dissected out bilaterally.  The patient was then heparinized.\n\nThe 7-French sheaths were then placed retrograde bilaterally.\n\nA stiff Amplatz wires were then placed up the right femoral artery and a stiff Amplatz were placed left side a calibrated catheter was placed up the right side.  The calibrated aortogram was the done.  We marked the renal arteries aortic bifurcation and bifurcation, common iliac arteries.  We then preceded placement of the main trunk, by replacing the 7 French sheath in the left groin area with 18-french sheath and then deployed the trunk body just below the take off renal arteries.\n\nOnce the main trunk has been deployed within wired _____ then deployed an iliac limb down in to the right common iliac artery.  As noted above, we then had to place an iliac extension, down in the external iliac artery to exclude the right common iliac artery and resume completely.\n\nFollowing completion of the above all arteries were ballooned appropriately.  A completion angiogram was done which showed late small type 2 leak just under the take off renal arteries.  The area was ballooned aggressively.  It was felt that this would dissolve as discussed above.\n\nFollowing completion of the above all wire sheaths etc., were removed from both groin areas.  Both femoral arteries were repaired by primary suture technique.  Flow was then reestablished to the lower extremities, and protamine was given to reverse the heparin.\n\nBoth surgical sites were then irrigated thoroughly.  Meticulous hemostasis was achieved.

She requested appendectomy because of the concern of future diagnostic dilemma with pain crisis.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and appendectomy were recommended to her.  The procedure was explained in detail including the risks of bleeding, infection, biliary injury, retained common duct stones.  After answering her questions, she wished to proceed and gave informed consent.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: \n The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine on the operating table.  She was positively identified and the correct surgical site and procedure reviewed.  After successful administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the skin of the abdomen was prepped with chlorhexidine solution and sterilely draped.\n\nThe infraumbilical skin was infiltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and horizontal incision created.  The linea alba was grasped with a hemostat and Veress needle was placed into the peritoneal cavity and used to insufflate carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm expandable disposable trocar was placed and through this a 30 degree laparoscope was used to inspect the peritoneal cavity.  Upper abdominal anatomy was normal.  Pelvic laparoscopy revealed bilaterally closed internal inguinal rings.  Additional trocars were placed under direct vision including a 5-mm reusable in the right lateral _____.  There was a 12-mm expandable disposable in the right upper quadrant and a 5-mm reusable in the subxiphoid region.  Using these, the gallbladder was grasped and retraced cephalad.  Adhesions were taken down over the cystic duct and the duct was circumferentially dissected and clipped at the gallbladder cystic duct junction.  A small ductotomy was created.  Reddick cholangiogram catheter was then placed within the duct and the balloon inflated.  Continuous fluoroscopy was used to instill contrast material.  This showed normal common bile duct which entered the duodenum without obstruction.  There was no evidence of common bile duct stones.  The cholangiogram catheter was removed.  The duct was doubly clipped and divided.  The artery was divided and cauterized.  The gallbladder was taken out of the gallbladder fossa.  It was then placed in Endocatch bag and left in the abdomen.  Attention was then paid to the appendix.  The appendix was identified and window was made in the mesoappendix at the base.  This was amputated with an Endo-GIA stapler.  The mesoappendix was divided with an Endo-GIA vascular stapler.  This was placed in another Endocatch bag.  The abdomen was then irrigated.  Hemostasis was satisfactory.  Both the appendix and gallbladder were removed and sent for pathology.  All trocars were removed.  The 12-mm port sites were closed with 2-0 PDS figure-of-eight fascial sutures.  The umbilical skin was reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl Rapide.  The remaining skin incisions were closed with 5-0 Monocryl subcuticular suture.  The skin was cleaned.  Mastisol, Steri-Strips and band-aids were applied.  The patient was awakened, extubated in the operating room, transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[667, 671, "ANATOMY"], [1567, 1573, "ANATOMY"], [1623, 1637, "ANATOMY"], [1878, 1889, "ANATOMY"], [1961, 1972, "ANATOMY"], [1981, 1985, "ANATOMY"], [2037, 2048, "ANATOMY"], [2049, 2060, "ANATOMY"], [2162, 2166, "ANATOMY"], [2276, 2292, "ANATOMY"], [2311, 2319, "ANATOMY"], [2367, 2383, "ANATOMY"], [2438, 2442, "ANATOMY"], [2480, 2486, "ANATOMY"], [2520, 2531, "ANATOMY"], [2553, 2564, "ANATOMY"], [2666, 2674, "ANATOMY"], [2681, 2689, "ANATOMY"], [2732, 2744, "ANATOMY"], [2809, 2821, "ANATOMY"], [2851, 2859, "ANATOMY"], [2985, 2993, "ANATOMY"], [2998, 3009, "ANATOMY"], [3159, 3173, "ANATOMY"], [81, 95, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [138, 152, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [323, 341, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [366, 380, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2786, 2790, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2842, 2846, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3366, 3370, "DISEASESYNDROME"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\n  Ms. Connor is a 50-year-old female who returns to clinic for a wound check.  The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed.  On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound.  She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom.  She is having good ostomy output.  She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy.  She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work.  She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain.  She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: \n Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds.  This is a pleasant female in no acute distress.  The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar.  There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant.  There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: \n This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis.  Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR.  She is functioning well with her ileostomy.  She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter.  I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less.  I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks.  I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy.  She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain.  I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain.  I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain.  The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery.  This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping.  I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery.  I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her.  Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well.  Again, her quality of life is significantly improved.  She is happy with her performance.  We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[2139, 2146, "ANATOMY"], [2874, 2884, "ANATOMY"], [3087, 3092, "ANATOMY"], [3120, 3127, "ANATOMY"], [3294, 3298, "ANATOMY"], [73, 75, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [203, 213, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [459, 467, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1543, 1553, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [62, 69, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [547, 553, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [555, 561, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [563, 569, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [574, 582, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [616, 633, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [772, 776, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [892, 909, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [941, 945, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [978, 992, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1577, 1592, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2468, 2482, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2626, 2630, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2727, 2731, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2834, 2838, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2893, 2901, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3054, 3062, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3455, 3470, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Acute acalculous cholecystitis.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n  Acute hemorrhagic cholecystitis.\n\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n Open cholecystectomy.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n Epidural with local.\n\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: \n None.\n\n\nDISPOSITION: \n The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.\n\n\nSPECIMEN:  \nGallbladder.\n\n\nBRIEF HISTORY:  \nThe patient is a 73-year-old female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 07/23/2003 secondary to a fall at home from which the patient suffered a right shoulder as well as hip fracture.  The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department.  Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure.  The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain.  During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder.  The patient did well postdrainage.  The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp.  However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003.  A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction.  A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction.  There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent.  Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy.  Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed.\n\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  \nThe patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas.  There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder.  The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed.\n\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE: \n After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia.  Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine.  A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel.  Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery.  Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel.  Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered .  The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view.  Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified.  The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors.  The cystic duct was identified.  A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery.  A plane was created.  The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel.  The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections.  Permanent sections are still pending.  The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen.  The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures.  Skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[397, 408, "ANATOMY"], [606, 609, "ANATOMY"], [699, 702, "ANATOMY"], [1337, 1348, "ANATOMY"], [1754, 1765, "ANATOMY"], [1850, 1854, "ANATOMY"], [1906, 1917, "ANATOMY"], [2405, 2416, "ANATOMY"], [2572, 2583, "ANATOMY"], [2628, 2639, "ANATOMY"], [3185, 3198, "ANATOMY"], [3366, 3377, "ANATOMY"], [3474, 3486, "ANATOMY"], [3549, 3562, "ANATOMY"], [3567, 3578, "ANATOMY"], [3620, 3633, "ANATOMY"], [3682, 3693, "ANATOMY"], [3741, 3752, "ANATOMY"], [3906, 3917, "ANATOMY"], [4097, 4108, "ANATOMY"], [4454, 4467, "ANATOMY"], [4539, 4552, "ANATOMY"], [69, 99, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [130, 161, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [874, 878, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1161, 1191, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2222, 2226, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2648, 2653, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3944, 3949, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4217, 4230, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [951, 965, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1082, 1102, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1624, 1632, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Acute cholecystitis.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n  Acute cholecystitis.\n\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\n  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General.\n\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:\n  Zero.\n\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: \n None.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room, and after obtaining adequate general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position.  The abdominal area was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A small skin incision was made below the umbilicus.  It was carried down in the transverse direction on the side of her old incision.  It was carried down to the fascia.  An open pneumoperitoneum was created with Hasson technique.  Three additional ports were placed in the usual fashion.  The gallbladder was found to be acutely inflamed, distended, and with some necrotic areas.  It was carefully retracted from the isthmus, and the cystic structure was then carefully identified, dissected, and divided between double clips.  The gallbladder was then taken down from the gallbladder fossa with electrocautery.  There was some bleeding from the gallbladder fossa that was meticulously controlled with a Bovie.  The gallbladder was then finally removed via the umbilical port with some difficulty because of the size of the gallbladder and size of the stones.  The fascia had to be opened.  The gallbladder had to be opened, and the stones had to be extracted carefully.  When it was completed, I went back to the abdomen and achieved complete hemostasis.  The ports were then removed under direct vision with the scope.  The fascia of the umbilical wound was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl.

General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation.  His abdomen was prepped and draped in a standard, sterile surgical fashion.  A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  Marcaine was injected into his umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced in his abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg and a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through his umbilicus.  A 5-mm port was then placed just to the right side of the umbilicus.  Another 5-mm port was placed just suprapubic in the midline.  Upon inspection of the cecum, I was able find an inflamed and indurated appendix.  I was able to clear the mesentery at the base of the appendix between the appendix and the cecum.  I fired a white load stapler across the appendix at its base and fired a grey load stapler across the mesentery, and thereby divided the mesentery and freed the appendix.  I put the appendix in an Endocatch bag and removed it through the umbilicus.  I irrigated out the abdomen.

The patient has now begun to have comorbidities related to the obesity.  The patient has attended our bariatric seminar and met with our dietician and psychologist.  The patient has read through our comprehensive handout and understands the risks and benefits of bypass surgery as evidenced by the signing of our consent form.\n\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL: \n The risks and benefits were explained to the patient.  Consent was obtained.  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation.  A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  All pressure points were carefully padded, and sequential compression devices were placed on the legs.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in standard, sterile, surgical fashion.  Marcaine was injected into the umbilicus.   \n\nA small incision was made, and a Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  Then a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed in the umbilicus.  Laparoscopic examination showed no injuries from entry.  I then placed a 5-mm port in the left side just subcostal and just anterior to the mid-axillary line.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  On the right side just subcostal and anterior to the mid-axillary line, I placed another 5-mm port.  Another 5-mm port was placed just to the right of the midline and just subxiphoid, and a few centimeters below that, a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed. \n\nWe began by identifying the colon and lifting the transverse colon up and thereby identifying the ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm.  I divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided across the mesentery utilizing a LigaSure device all the way down to its base.  I then ran the distal bowel down 100 cm, and at 100 cm I made a hole in the Roux limb and a hole in the duodenogastric limb.  I placed a 45 white load stapler into the abdomen and put 1 side of the white load stapler in the duodenogastric limb and 1 side in the Roux limb.  I fired the stapler, thereby creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures and then stapled across it with a white load GIA stapler. \n\nI then did a Brolin anti-obstruction stitch with an interrupted Surgidac suture.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I then divided the omentum all the way down to the transverse colon in order to create a pathway to place the Roux limb antecolic, antegastric.   \n\nI then placed the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position and placed a liver retractor.  I first identified the angle of His and made sure that it was clearly visible.  I then had Anesthesia drop a balloon into the stomach and blow it up to 30 cc.  Below that, I then cleared the mesentery at the lesser curve and got behind the stomach into the lesser space.  I then fired a blue load stapler transversely across the stomach, after checking with Anesthesia that everything had been removed from the stomach.  I then made a hole into the stomach at the mid portion of the superior staple line.  I then made an incision on the greater curve and made a gastrotomy.  I then brought a 25 EEA anvil with a stitch attached to it into the abdominal cavity.  I placed an angulating grasper into the gastrotomy above my staple line and had it come out through the gastrotomy at the greater curve.  I grabbed the anvil and pulled it through the greater curve gastrotomy and had the stem come out through the superior staple line so that the stem was now coming out through the base of my soon-to-be gastric pouch.\n\nI then completed my pouch by firing 60 blue loads with SeamGuard cephalad up and through the angle of His.  After creating the pouch, I then closed the gastrotomy on the greater curve by firing across it with blue load stapler.  Once this had been done, I brought up the Roux limb.  I cut a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and passed a 25 EEA stapler into the abdomen through the 15-mm port site and had it go in through the enterotomy.  I had a spike come out on the antimesenteric portion of the small bowel.  I removed the spike and joined the stapler with the anvil and fired the stapler, thereby creating the anastomosis, and then removed the EEA stapler.  I divided the end of the redundant portion of the Roux limb that had the enterotomy utilizing a white load stapler and removed that through the 15-mm port site.  I then had a pretty straight shot from the pouch into the small bowel.  I put additional 3-0 Vicryl sutures in the corners in order to take off any tension and further secure the wound.  I then put a bowel clamp on the bowel.  I went above and performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. \n\nI placed a scope into the mouth and down through the esophagus with ease.  I passed it into the stomach pouch.  I distended up the pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen laparoscopically.  I was able to pass the scope easily across the anastomosis.  No bleeding was seen.  I then withdrew the scope and scrubbed back into the case.  I closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I then put a 10-flat Jackson-Pratt through the left upper quadrant incision and sutured that in place using nylon.   \n\nI then closed the skin of all incisions with a running Monocryl.  Prior to closing, I irrigated the 15-mm port site with dilute Betadine.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[1105, 1112, "ANATOMY"], [1226, 1230, "ANATOMY"], [2066, 2071, "ANATOMY"], [2088, 2104, "ANATOMY"], [2136, 2154, "ANATOMY"], [2167, 2178, "ANATOMY"], [2220, 2231, "ANATOMY"], [2381, 2386, "ANATOMY"], [2440, 2444, "ANATOMY"], [2478, 2482, "ANATOMY"], [2598, 2602, "ANATOMY"], [2626, 2630, "ANATOMY"], [2995, 3002, "ANATOMY"], [3027, 3043, "ANATOMY"], [3091, 3095, "ANATOMY"], [3238, 3250, "ANATOMY"], [3341, 3348, "ANATOMY"], [3455, 3462, "ANATOMY"], [3544, 3551, "ANATOMY"], [3626, 3633, "ANATOMY"], [3664, 3671, "ANATOMY"], [4324, 4336, "ANATOMY"], [4507, 4511, "ANATOMY"], [4569, 4573, "ANATOMY"], [4749, 4760, "ANATOMY"], [4968, 4972, "ANATOMY"], [5133, 5144, "ANATOMY"], [5275, 5280, "ANATOMY"], [5294, 5299, "ANATOMY"], [5415, 5424, "ANATOMY"], [5458, 5465, "ANATOMY"], [69, 83, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [115, 129, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [547, 554, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3197, 3202, "DISEASESYNDROME"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nMEDICATIONS:\n\n1.

The patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef intravenously piggyback.  The abdomen was prepared and draped in routine sterile fashion.\n\nA 1-cm incision was made at the umbilicus and a Veress needle was inserted.  Saline test was performed.  Satisfactory pneumoperitoneum was achieved by insufflation of CO2 to a pressure of 14 mmHg.  The Veress needle was removed.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted.  Inspection of the peritoneal cavity revealed a gallbladder that was soft and without adhesions to it.  It was largely mobile.  The liver had a normal appearance as did the peritoneal cavity.  A 5-mm cannula was inserted in the right upper quadrant anterior axillary line.  A second 5-mm cannula was inserted in the subcostal space.  A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted into the upper midline.\n\nThe gallbladder was reflected in a cephalad direction.  The gallbladder was punctured with the aspirating needle, and under C-arm fluoroscopy was filled with contrast, filling the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees, which appeared normal.  Extra contrast was aspirated and the aspirating needle was removed.  The ampulla was grasped with a second grasper, opening the triangle of Calot.  The cystic duct was dissected and exposed at its junction with the ampulla, was controlled with a hemoclip, digitally controlled with two clips and divided.  This was done while the common duct was in full visualization.  The cystic artery was similarly controlled and divided.  The gallbladder was dissected from its bed and separated from the liver, brought to the outside through the upper midline cannula and removed.\n\nThe subhepatic and subphrenic spaces were irrigated thoroughly with saline solution.  There was oozing and bleeding from the lateral 5-mm cannula site, but this stopped spontaneously with removal of the cannula.  The subphrenic and subhepatic spaces were again irrigated thoroughly with saline until clear.  Hemostasis was excellent.  CO2 was evacuated and the camera removed.  The umbilical fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, the subcu with 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with 4-0 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.

The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills.  She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals.  The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time.  The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation.\n\n\nSTUDY:\n  Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair.  To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).  The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation.\n\n\nORAL STAGE:  \nThe patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport.  No spillage out lips.  The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars.  The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state.  Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation.  We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid.\n\n\nPHARYNGEAL STAGE:  \nNo aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.  She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow.\n\n\nCERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  \nThe patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.\n\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:  \nThe patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation.  She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars.  Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician.\n\n\nPLAN:  \nBased on this evaluation, the following is recommended:\n1.  The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids.  She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux.\n2.  The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars.\n\nThe above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care.

The patient was referred for an outpatient speech and language pathology consult to increase speech and swallowing abilities.  The patient is currently NPO with G-tube to meet all of his hydration and nutritional needs.  He has been NPO since April 2008.  The patient also has a trach, which she is currently using finger occlusion to achieve voicing.\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\n  Lortab.\n\n\nPREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY: \n Cardiac stent in 2000.\n\n\nPATIENT'S GOAL: \n To eat again by mouth.\n\n\nSTUDY:  \nA trial of Passy-Muir valve was completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing and also to improve his secretion management.  A clinical swallow evaluation was not completed due to the severity of the patient's mucus and lack of saliva control.\n\nThe patient's laryngeal area was palpated during a dry swallow and he does have significantly reduced laryngeal elevation and radiation fibrosis.  The further evaluate of his swallowing function is safety; a modified barium swallow study needs to be concluded to objectively evaluate his swallow safety, and to rule out aspiration.  A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy was completed to determine if this therapy protocol will be beneficial and improving the patient's swallowing function and safety.\n\nFor his neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, the type was BMR with a single mode cycle time is 4 seconds and 12 seconds off with frequency was 60 __________ with a ramp of 2 seconds, phase duration was 220 with an output of 99 milliamps.  Electrodes were placed on the suprahyoid/submandibular triangle with an upright body position, trial length was 10 minutes.  On a pain scale, the patient reported no pain with the electrical stimulation therapy.\n\n\nFINDINGS:  \nThe patient was able to tolerate a 5-minute placement of the Passy-Muir valve.  He reported no discomfort on the inhalation; however, he felt some resistance on exhalation.  Instructions were given on care placement and cleaning of the Passy-Muir valve.  The patient was instructed to buildup tolerance over the next several days of his Passy-Muir valve and to remove the valve at anytime or he is going to be sleeping or napping throughout the day.  The patient's voicing did improve with the Passy-Muir valve due to decreased leakage from his trach secondary to finger occlusion.  Mucus production also seemed to decrease when the Passy-Muir was placed.\n\nOn the dry swallow during this evaluation, the patient's laryngeal area is reduced and tissues around his larynx and showed radiation fibrosis.  The patient's neck range of motion appears to be adequate and within normal limits.\n\nA trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy:\nThe patient tolerating the neuromuscular electrical stimulation, we did achieve poor passive response, but these muscles were contracting and the larynx was moving upon stimulation.  The patient was able to actively swallow with stimulation approximately 30% of presentation.\n\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: \n The patient with a history of head and neck cancer status post radiation and chemotherapy with radiation fibrosis, which is impeding his swallowing abilities.  The patient would benefit from outpatient skilled speech therapy for neuromuscular electrical stimulation for muscle reeducation to improve his swallowing function and safety and he would benefit from a placement of a Passy-Muir valve to have hands-free communication.\n\n\nPLAN OF CARE: \n Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week to include neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, Passy-Muir placement and a completion of the modified barium swallow study.\n\n\nSHORT-TERM GOALS (6 WEEKS):\n\n1.  Completion of modified barium swallow study.\n2.  The patient will coordinate volitional swallow with greater than 75% of the neuromuscular electrical stimulations.\n3.  The patient will increase laryngeal elevation by 50% for airway protection.\n4.  The patient will tolerate placement of Passy-Muir valve for greater than 2 hours during awaking hours.\n5.  The patient will tolerate therapeutic feedings with the speech and language pathologist without signs and symptoms of aspiration.\n6.  The patient will decrease mild facial restrictions to the anterior neck by 50% to increase laryngeal movement.\n\n\nLONG-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS):\n\n1.  The patient will improve secretion management to tolerable levels.\n2.  The patient will increase amount and oral consistency of p.o. intake tolerated without signs and symptoms of aspirations.\n3.  The patient will be able to communicate without using finger occlusion with the assistance of a Passy-Muir valve.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[541, 547, "ANATOMY"], [641, 648, "ANATOMY"], [718, 725, "ANATOMY"], [792, 797, "ANATOMY"], [1311, 1318, "ANATOMY"], [2537, 2543, "ANATOMY"], [2736, 2742, "ANATOMY"], [2860, 2867, "ANATOMY"], [3063, 3069, "ANATOMY"], [4111, 4117, "ANATOMY"], [4771, 4777, "ANATOMY"], [1877, 1881, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1913, 1917, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2068, 2078, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4347, 4355, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4688, 4696, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n  Positive peptic ulcer disease.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n  Gastritis.\n\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photography and biopsy.\n\n\nGROSS FINDINGS:\n  The patient had a history of peptic ulcer disease, epigastric abdominal pain x2 months, being evaluated at this time for ulcer disease.\n\nUpon endoscopy, gastroesophageal junction was at 40 cm, no esophageal tumor, varices, strictures, masses, or no reflux esophagitis was noted.

A curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus.  Through this incision, the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization.  Once this complete, insufflation was begun.  Once insufflation was adequate, additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant.  Once all four ports were placed, the right upper quadrant was then explored.  The patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis.  This was taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall.  Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area.  Once the adhesions were fully removed, the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction.  At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected.  The gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder.  Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery was achieved.  The gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port.  A JP drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture.  Next, the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator.  Once this was complete, the additional ports were able to be removed.  The fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion.  All skin incisions were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain.  The skin was reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique.

Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago.  The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke.  The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE: \n Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC.  The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment.  To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1).\n\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\nORAL STAGE:\n  Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid.  Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow.\n\n\nPHARYNGEAL STAGE: \n No aspiration was observed during this evaluation.  Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only.  Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies.  The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits.  Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits.\n\n\nCERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE:  \nThe patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.  Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation.\n\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:\n  No aspiration was noted during this evaluation.  Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid.  The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration.\n\n\nPROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: \nBased on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good.\n\n\nPLAN: \n Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made:\n1.  The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration.\n2.  The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation.\n3.

Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis.  Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound.  She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm.  She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct.  She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP.  On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.  She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture.  Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization.  She was also noted to have an elevated CA99.  She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation.  After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \nSignificant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

She had three brothers that died of complications from open heart surgery.  Her parents and brothers all had hypertension.  Her younger brother died at the age of 18 of infection from a butcher's shop.  He was cutting Argentinean beef and contracted an infection and died within 24 hours.  She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia.  She has two adult sons who are in good health.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \n The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years.  Her first husband died in 1995.  She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \nThe patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed.  She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well.  She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms.  As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup.  She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure.  She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats.  She has had loose stools.

Bile duct brushings are notable for atypical cell clusters present, highly suspicious for carcinoma.\n\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN: \n This is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who has findings suspicious for a cholangiocarcinoma.  The patient was referred to our office to discuss this diagnosis.  I spent greater than an hour with the patient and her husband discussing this potential diagnosis, reviewing the anatomy and answering questions.  She is yet to have a surgical consultation, and we discussed the difficulty that we sometimes have with patients meeting surgical criteria to manage cholangiocarcinoma.  The patient also had questions about the Medical University and possibly seeking a second opinion.  She will contact our office after her surgical consultation if she needs assistance with obtaining a second opinion.  We also talked about our clinical research program here.  Currently, we do have a Phase II Study for advanced gallbladder carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma for patients that are unresectable.  We will go ahead and provide her with a consent form so that she can look that over and it will give her some more information about the malignancy and treatment approaches.  We will schedule her for followup in three weeks.  We will also schedule her for PET/CT scan for staging.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[323, 334, "ANATOMY"], [346, 357, "ANATOMY"], [401, 417, "ANATOMY"], [580, 596, "ANATOMY"], [696, 712, "ANATOMY"], [932, 948, "ANATOMY"], [1400, 1403, "ANATOMY"], [1419, 1427, "ANATOMY"], [1474, 1484, "ANATOMY"], [1735, 1740, "ANATOMY"], [1811, 1816, "ANATOMY"], [2429, 2435, "ANATOMY"], [3052, 3057, "ANATOMY"], [3203, 3211, "ANATOMY"], [3240, 3246, "ANATOMY"], [3379, 3384, "ANATOMY"], [3572, 3589, "ANATOMY"], [3916, 3925, "ANATOMY"], [4848, 4859, "ANATOMY"], [228, 233, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1349, 1361, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1366, 1380, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1860, 1872, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3185, 3195, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3367, 3377, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [127, 134, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2084, 2090, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2585, 2592, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2643, 2651, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2904, 2910, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2912, 2918, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2920, 2932, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2947, 2959, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3542, 3560, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3602, 3607, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Chronic cholecystitis.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  \nChronic cholecystitis.\n\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:  \nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n\nBLOOD LOSS: \n Minimal.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General endotracheal anesthesia.\n\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: \n None.\n\n\nCONDITION: \n Stable.\n\n\nDRAINS: \n None.\n\n\nDISPOSITION:  \nTo recovery room and to home.\n\n\nFLUIDS:  \nCrystalloid.\n\n\nFINDINGS: \n Consistent with chronic cholecystitis.

He presented now after informed consent for the above procedure.\n\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \nThe patient was identified in the preanesthesia area, then taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position on the operating table, and induced under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities.  The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion.  Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine.  The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade.  The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg.  The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision.  The right upper quadrant was well visualized.  The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions.  The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector.  Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp.  The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided.  The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided.  The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis.  Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear.  No active bleeding or oozing was seen.  All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place.  The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port.  The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology.  The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization.  The insufflation was allowed to escape.  The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures.  Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[1132, 1149, "ANATOMY"], [1809, 1820, "ANATOMY"], [1900, 1906, "ANATOMY"], [1914, 1925, "ANATOMY"], [2038, 2049, "ANATOMY"], [2195, 2207, "ANATOMY"], [2212, 2223, "ANATOMY"], [2243, 2254, "ANATOMY"], [2328, 2339, "ANATOMY"], [2378, 2391, "ANATOMY"], [2462, 2473, "ANATOMY"], [2611, 2622, "ANATOMY"], [2762, 2773, "ANATOMY"], [2859, 2870, "ANATOMY"], [69, 90, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [121, 142, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [441, 462, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [716, 730, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [640, 654, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["        (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.

He also had refractory dyspepsia despite b.i.d., Nexium therapy.  The patient does use alcohol and tobacco.  The patient gave informed consent for the procedure.\n\n\nGROSS FINDINGS: \n At the time of colonoscopy, the entire length of colon was visualized.  The patient was found to have a sigmoid diverticulosis.  He also was found to have some colonic polyps at 35 cm and 15 cm.  The polyps were large enough to be treated with snare cautery technique.  The polyps were achieved and submitted to pathology.  EGD did confirm acute and chronic gastritis.  The biopsies were performed for H&amp;E and CLO testing.  The patient had no evidence of distal esophagitis or ulcers.  No mass lesions were seen.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite with the heart and lungs examination unremarkable.  The vital signs were monitored and found to be stable throughout the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral position where intravenous Demerol and Versed were given in a titrated fashion.\n\nThe video Olympus colonoscope was advanced per anus and without difficulty to the level of cecum.  Photographic documentation of the diverticulosis and polyps were obtained.  The patient's polyps were removed in a similar fashion, each removed with snare cautery.  The polyps were encircled at their stalk.  Increasing the tension and cautery was applied as coagulation and cutting blunt mode, 15/15 was utilized.  Good blanching was seen.  The polyp was retrieved with the suction port of the scope.  The patient was re-scoped to the polyp levels to confirm that there was no evidence of perforation or bleeding at the polypectomy site.  Diverticulosis coli was also noted.  With colonoscopy completed, the patient was then turned for EGD.  The oropharynx was previously anesthetized with Cetacaine spray and a biteblock was placed.  Video Olympus GIF gastroscope model was inserted per os and advanced without difficulty through the hypopharynx.  The esophagus revealed a GE junction at 39 cm.  The GE junction was grossly within normal limits.  The stomach was entered and distended with air.  Acute and chronic gastritis features as stated were appreciated.  The pylorus was traversed with normal duodenum.  The stomach was again reentered.  Retroflex maneuver of the scope confirmed that there was no evidence of hiatal hernia.  There were no ulcers or mass lesions seen.  The patient had biopsy performed of the antrum for H&amp;E and CLO testing.  There was no evidence of untoward bleeding at biopsy sites.  Insufflated air was removed with withdrawal of the scope.  The patient will be placed on a reflux diet, given instruction and information on Nexium usage.  Additional recommendations will follow pending biopsy results.  He is to also abstain from alcohol and tobacco.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.\n\nA transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness.  Sharp dissection utilizing Bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia.  The fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp.  The internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread.  The transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean.\n\nThe cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound.  After the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between Kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 Vicryl ties.  The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix.  The base was ligated with 2-0 Vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp.  The stump of the appendix was cauterized and the cecum was returned to the abdomen.\n\nThe peritoneum was irrigated with warm sterile saline.  The mesoappendix and cecum were examined for hemostasis which was present.  The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the peritoneum and 0 Vicryl for the internal oblique and external oblique layers.  The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  A dressing was placed on the wound.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.\n\nHaving tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[659, 675, "ANATOMY"], [703, 719, "ANATOMY"], [809, 825, "ANATOMY"], [907, 928, "ANATOMY"], [1142, 1147, "ANATOMY"], [1260, 1268, "ANATOMY"], [1389, 1397, "ANATOMY"], [1474, 1482, "ANATOMY"], [1557, 1565, "ANATOMY"], [1611, 1619, "ANATOMY"], [1643, 1648, "ANATOMY"], [1739, 1751, "ANATOMY"], [1756, 1761, "ANATOMY"], [1899, 1915, "ANATOMY"], [1920, 1936, "ANATOMY"], [69, 81, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [112, 124, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [575, 585, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:  \nAfter informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.\n\nA 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.\n\nThe remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 3 other trocars were placed.  The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position.  The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior iliac spine.  The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.\n\nThe patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder.  A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.\n\nA laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct proximally and distally.  The duct was divided between the clips.  The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct.  The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posterior to the cystic duct.  It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues.  A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally.  The artery was divided between the clips.  The 2 midline port sites were injected with 5% Marcaine.\n\nAfter the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula.  The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula.  As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen.  The neck of the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen.  Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.\n\nBoth midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  Dressings were applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.\n\nHaving tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[479, 485, "ANATOMY"], [1118, 1124, "ANATOMY"], [1180, 1194, "ANATOMY"], [1387, 1392, "ANATOMY"], [1663, 1674, "ANATOMY"], [2069, 2080, "ANATOMY"], [2111, 2115, "ANATOMY"], [2221, 2237, "ANATOMY"], [2244, 2257, "ANATOMY"], [2307, 2318, "ANATOMY"], [2491, 2504, "ANATOMY"], [2535, 2541, "ANATOMY"], [2669, 2680, "ANATOMY"], [2795, 2806, "ANATOMY"], [2911, 2922, "ANATOMY"], [3050, 3061, "ANATOMY"], [3103, 3114, "ANATOMY"], [809, 825, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2690, 2695, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [731, 737, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1856, 1862, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n Nissen fundoplication.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: \n After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table.  General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities.  TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis.  Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection.\n\nA 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction.  A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg.  A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.\n\nThe remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed.  Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.  The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position.\n\nThe triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula.  The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane.  The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane.  The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice.  This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus.  Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane.\n\nThe liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.  The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve.  This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve.\n\nAttention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus.  At its left border, the left crus was identified.  The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed.  The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch.  By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia.\n\nThe next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch.  This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel.  This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade.  The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port.  Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall.  Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus.  A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus.  The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.\n\nThe 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired.  Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice.\n\nThe last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve.  With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left.  It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap.  The\n\n52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring.  Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control.  The skin incision was approximated with skin staples.  A dressing was then applied.

Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction.  There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening.  The scope was withdrawn.  A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position).  Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening.  There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material.  Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable.  In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area.

The patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods.  She had had multiple attacks in the past of these complaints.  She was discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination.  Additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis.  The patient was recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms.  She was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed.\n\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  The patient received preoperative antibiotics with Kefzol.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia.  Once the adequate sedation was achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel.  Utilizing a Veress needle, the Veress needle was inserted intra-abdominally and was hooked to the CO2 insufflation.  The abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg.  After adequate insufflation was achieved, the laparoscopic camera was inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder as well as omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder.  Decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy was decided.  A subxiphoid transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar was inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen.  Two 5 mm ports were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin.  All ports were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization.  After all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder was grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder.  Adhesions adjacent were taken down with a Maryland dissector.  Once this was performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly.  This helped to better delineate the cystic duct as well as the cystic artery.  Utilizing Maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one.  Utilizing Endoclips, clips were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally.  Utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated.  Next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder was carefully dissected off the liver bed.  Electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way.  The gallbladder was punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary contents did drained into the abdomen.  No evidence of stones were visualized.  Once the gallbladder was completely excised from the liver bed, an EndoCatch was placed and the gallbladder was inserted into EndoCatch and removed from the subxiphoid port.  This was sent off as an specimen, a gallstone was identified within the gallbladder.  Next, utilizing copious amounts of irrigation, the abdomen was irrigated.  A small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration was grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery was completely excised off the left lobe of the liver.  This was also taken and sent off as specimen.  The abdomen was then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation was identified.  All laparoscopic ports were removed under direct visualization.  The abdomen was de-insufflated.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, the abdominal fascia was approximated with a figure-of-eight suture in the supraumbilical and subxiphoid region.

Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.\n\nThe patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.  She has done well since that time.  She has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable.  She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved.  The patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube.  She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools.  Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.\n\nThe patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.\n\n\nIMPRESSION: \n The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.\n\n\nPLAN:  \nThe patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[393, 399, "ANATOMY"], [697, 703, "ANATOMY"], [1334, 1339, "ANATOMY"], [1958, 1964, "ANATOMY"], [1706, 1714, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [141, 148, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [857, 865, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [938, 946, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  \n\n1.  Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax.\n2.  Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: \n Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General.\n\n\nINDICATION:  \nThe patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites.  The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces.  Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically.  However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen.  Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole.  This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease.  We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt.\n\n\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  \nThe patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended.  Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.  What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon.  It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery.  There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option.  Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that.\n\nThe lymphatic abnormality was extensive.  They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery.  They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well.  No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified.  Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  \nThe patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow.  We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above.  Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia.  As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described.  The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites.  The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems.  Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.  We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak.  The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[203, 213, "ANATOMY"], [668, 681, "ANATOMY"], [936, 945, "ANATOMY"], [1018, 1031, "ANATOMY"], [1721, 1732, "ANATOMY"], [1800, 1811, "ANATOMY"], [1833, 1838, "ANATOMY"], [1844, 1849, "ANATOMY"], [1874, 1889, "ANATOMY"], [2077, 2083, "ANATOMY"], [2134, 2141, "ANATOMY"], [2256, 2267, "ANATOMY"], [2365, 2380, "ANATOMY"], [2569, 2574, "ANATOMY"], [2737, 2742, "ANATOMY"], [3578, 3592, "ANATOMY"], [3665, 3669, "ANATOMY"], [3681, 3686, "ANATOMY"], [3828, 3833, "ANATOMY"], [3933, 3943, "ANATOMY"], [4033, 4044, "ANATOMY"], [4054, 4072, "ANATOMY"], [4096, 4103, "ANATOMY"], [4176, 4191, "ANATOMY"], [4196, 4201, "ANATOMY"], [4303, 4308, "ANATOMY"], [4416, 4426, "ANATOMY"], [4550, 4560, "ANATOMY"], [4694, 4716, "ANATOMY"], [5204, 5214, "ANATOMY"], [85, 100, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [105, 116, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [229, 245, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [398, 411, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [416, 431, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [562, 575, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [877, 892, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1249, 1256, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1536, 1551, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1636, 1651, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1656, 1667, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2841, 2866, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3771, 3786, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3959, 3975, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4011, 4026, "DISEASESYNDROME"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: \n Malnutrition and dysphagia.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: \n Malnutrition and dysphagia with two antral polyps and large hiatal hernia.\n\n\nPROCEDURES: \n Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy of one of the polyps and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n IV sedation, 1% Xylocaine locally.\n\n\nCONDITION:\n  Stable.\n\n\nOPERATIVE NOTE IN DETAIL: \n After risk of operation was explained to this patient's family, consent was obtained for surgery.

Her abdomen was prepped with alcohol and then Betadine.  Flexible gastroscope was passed down the esophagus, through the stomach into the duodenum.  No lesions were noted in the duodenum.  There appeared to be a few polyps in the antral area, two in the antrum.  Actually, one appeared to be almost covering the pylorus.  The scope was withdrawn back into the antrum.  On retroflexion, we could see a large hiatal hernia.  No other lesions were noted.  Biopsy was taken of one of the polyps.  The scope was left in position.  Anterior abdominal wall was prepped with Betadine, 1% Xylocaine was injected in the left epigastric area.

He was placed in the supine position and was given IV sedation by the Anesthesia Department.  An EGD was performed from above by Dr. X.  The stomach was transilluminated and an optimal position for the PEG tube was identified using the single poke method.

She admits to some nausea associated with it.  There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms.  The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant.  She had a leukocytosis of 12.8.  She did undergo a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which was non diagnostic for an acute appendicitis.  Given the severity of her abdominal examination and her persistence of her symptoms, we recommend the patient undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with probable need for laparoscopic appendectomy and possible open appendectomy.  The risks, benefits, complications of the procedure, she gave us informed consent to proceed.\n\n\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS:  \nExploration of the abdomen via laparoscopy revealed an appendix with suppurative fluid surrounding it, it was slightly enlarged.  The left ovary revealed some follicular cysts.  There was no evidence of adnexal masses and/or torsion of the fallopian tubes.  The uterus revealed no evidence of mass and/or fibroid tumors.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.\n\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE: \n The patient was brought to the operative suite, placed in the supine position.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The patient underwent general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient also received a preoperative dose of Ancef 1 gram IV.  After adequate sedation was achieved, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make an infraumbilical transverse incision utilizing a Veress needle.  Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen and the abdomen was insufflated approximately 15 mmHg.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a 10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  A video laparoscope was inserted into the infraumbilical trocar site and the abdomen was explored.  Next, a 5 mm port was inserted in the midclavicular line of the right upper quadrant region.  This was inserted under direct visualization.  Finally, a suprapubic 12 mm portal was created.  This was performed with #10 blade scalpel to create a transverse incision.  A bladed trocar was inserted into the suprapubic region.  This was done again under direct visualization.  Maryland dissector was inserted into the suprapubic region and a window was created between the appendix and mesoappendix at the base of the cecum.  This was done while the 5 mm trocar was used to grasp the middle portion of the appendix and retracted anteriorly.  Utilizing a endovascular stapling device, the appendix was transected and doubly stapled with this device.  Next, the mesoappendix was doubly stapled and transected with the endovascular stapling device.  The staple line was visualized and there was no evidence of bleeding.  The abdomen was fully irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The abdomen was then aspirated.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  All ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding from the port sites.  The infraumbilical and suprapubic ports were then closed.  The fascias were then closed with #0-Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle.  Once the fascias were closed, all incisions were closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The areas were cleaned, Steri-Strips were placed across the wound.  Sterile dressing was applied.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  She was extubated following the procedure, returned to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  She will be admitted to General Medical Floor and she will be followed closely in the early postoperative course.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[413, 421, "ANATOMY"], [1021, 1027, "ANATOMY"], [1478, 1486, "ANATOMY"], [1557, 1567, "ANATOMY"], [1663, 1678, "ANATOMY"], [1685, 1691, "ANATOMY"], [3040, 3048, "ANATOMY"], [3053, 3065, "ANATOMY"], [3085, 3090, "ANATOMY"], [3173, 3181, "ANATOMY"], [3255, 3263, "ANATOMY"], [3327, 3339, "ANATOMY"], [115, 133, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [164, 194, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [956, 970, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1061, 1079, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1492, 1503, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1593, 1598, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [90, 104, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [606, 620, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [736, 742, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [783, 789, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [791, 797, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [806, 828, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [868, 878, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [907, 917, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1157, 1165, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROCEDURE: \n Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies.\n\n\nINDICATION:\n  Abdominal pain.\n\n\nFINDINGS:\n  Antral erythema; 2 cm polypoid pyloric channel tissue, questionable inflammatory polyp which was biopsied; duodenal erythema and erosion.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS: \n Fentanyl 200 mcg and versed 6 mg.\n\n\nSCOPE: \n GIF-Q180.\n\n\nPROCEDURE DETAIL: \n Following the preprocedure patient assessment the procedure, goals, risks including bleeding, perforation and side effects of medications and alternatives were reviewed.

He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases.  The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.  The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.  This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct.  A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage.  The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable.  He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.  Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission.  This responded to Zofran.  It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself.

His sodium was 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO2 27, BUN of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3.  His bilirubin was 17.1, alk phos 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8.  He was tolerating a regular diet.  The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient, but in hospital, he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale.  The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary.  He will be further managed for his diabetes there.  The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings.  I discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient.  Certainly, there are modest benefits, which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer, though at some cost with morbidity.  The patient will consider this and will discuss this further with Dr. X.  \n\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n\n1.  Phenergan 25 mg q.6. p.r.n.\n2.  Duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d.\n3.  Benadryl 25-50 mg p.o. q.i.d. for pruritus.\n4.  Sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at Pelican Bay Infirmary.\n5.  The patient had initially been on enalapril here.  His hypertension will be managed by Dr. X as well.  \n\n\nPLAN: \n The patient should return for repeat ERCP if there are signs of stent occlusion such as fever, increased bilirubin, worsening pain.  In the meantime, he will be kept on a regular diet and activity per Dr. X.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[354, 364, "ANATOMY"], [384, 395, "ANATOMY"], [522, 526, "ANATOMY"], [641, 651, "ANATOMY"], [680, 689, "ANATOMY"], [2058, 2068, "ANATOMY"], [439, 444, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [876, 881, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1820, 1828, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2515, 2527, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [62, 69, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [119, 133, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [219, 227, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [237, 252, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [942, 948, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1130, 1136, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2662, 2667, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2700, 2704, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Screening. \n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n  Tiny Polyps.\n\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:  \n Colonoscopy.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:  \n The procedure, indications, and risks were explained to the patient, who understood and agreed.

The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort.  In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic.  He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts.  In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \nObtained from the medical chart.

He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs.\n\n\nDIAGNOSTICS: \n A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel.\n\n\nASSESSMENT: \n Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer.\n\n\nPLAN: \n The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago.  Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time.  The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state.  So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[94, 99, "ANATOMY"], [666, 671, "ANATOMY"], [865, 870, "ANATOMY"], [1496, 1501, "ANATOMY"], [1541, 1547, "ANATOMY"], [1671, 1676, "ANATOMY"], [1994, 1999, "ANATOMY"], [2017, 2022, "ANATOMY"], [2087, 2098, "ANATOMY"], [2134, 2139, "ANATOMY"], [2202, 2208, "ANATOMY"], [70, 86, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [235, 255, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [386, 406, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [526, 531, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [686, 702, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [714, 738, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [752, 757, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [793, 800, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [808, 813, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1008, 1045, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1058, 1067, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1073, 1093, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1095, 1107, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1121, 1138, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2165, 2172, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2174, 2198, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2223, 2243, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2268, 2287, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2289, 2293, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2295, 2301, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2307, 2320, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2850, 2855, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2973, 2993, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [122, 129, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [207, 215, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [220, 229, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [358, 364, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [369, 377, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [411, 431, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [908, 922, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [931, 946, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1435, 1455, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1713, 1723, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1852, 1862, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2511, 2517, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2522, 2530, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2536, 2550, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nINDICATION: \n  Rectal bleeding, constipation, abnormal CT scan, rule out inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n\nPREMEDICATION: \nSee procedure nurse NCS form.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:  \n   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral position and the above medications were titrated with adequate sedation.

Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the right upper quadrant where a small incision was made.  Blunt dissection was carried down to the fascia which was grasped with Kocher clamps.  A bladed 11-mm port was inserted without difficulty.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained using C02.  Under direct vision 2 additional, non-bladed, 11-mm trocars were placed, one in the left lower quadrant and one in the right lower quadrant.  There was some adhesion noted to the anterior midline which was taken down using the harmonic scalpel.  The cecum was visualized and found to have tattoo located almost opposite the ileocecal valve.  This was in what appeared to be an appropriate location for removal of this using the Endo GIA stapler without impinging on the ileocecal valve or the appendiceal orifice.  The appendix was somewhat retrocecal in position but otherwise looked normal.  The patient was also found to have ink marks in the peritoneal cavity diffusely indicating possible extravasation of dye.  There was enough however in the wall to identify the location of the polyp.  The lesion was grasped with a Babcock clamp and an Endo GIA stapler used to fire across this transversely. The specimen was then removed through the 12-mm port and examined on the back table.  The lateral margin was found to be closely involved with the specimen so I did not feel that it was clear.  I therefore lifted the lateral apex of the previous staple line and created a new staple line extending more laterally around the colon.  This new staple line was then opened on the back table and examined.  There was some residual polypoid material noted but the margins this time appeared to be clear.  The peritoneal cavity was then lavaged with antibiotic solution.  There were a few small areas of bleeding along the staple line which were treated with pinpoint electrocautery.  The trocars were removed under direct vision.  No bleeding was noted.  The bladed trocar site was closed using a figure-of-eight O Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were closed with running 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were placed followed by sterile Tegaderm dressing.

Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact.  The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures. Subcutaneous tissue was copiously lavaged and then the skin was closed with loosely approximated staples. Dry gauze dressing was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications. \r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[744, 749, "ANATOMY"], [793, 800, "ANATOMY"], [842, 849, "ANATOMY"], [1296, 1303, "ANATOMY"], [1378, 1385, "ANATOMY"], [1433, 1440, "ANATOMY"], [1445, 1454, "ANATOMY"], [1784, 1805, "ANATOMY"], [1951, 1958, "ANATOMY"], [2219, 2233, "ANATOMY"], [248, 273, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1166, 1173, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2505, 2508, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROBLEM:  \nRectal bleeding, positive celiac sprue panel.\n\n\nHISTORY:  \nThe patient is a 19-year-old Irish-Greek female who ever since elementary school has noted diarrhea, constipation, cramping, nausea, vomiting, bloating, belching, abdominal discomfort, change in bowel habits.  She noted that her symptoms were getting increasingly worse and so she went for evaluation and was finally tested for celiac sprue and found to have a positive tissue transglutaminase as well as antiendomysial antibody.  She has been on a gluten-free diet for approximately one week now and her symptoms are remarkably improved.  She actually has none of these symptoms since starting her gluten-free diet.  She has noted intermittent rectal bleeding with constipation, on the toilet tissue.  She feels remarkably better after starting a gluten-free diet.\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n No known drug allergies.\n\n\nOPERATIONS: \n She is status post a tonsillectomy as well as ear tubes.\n\n\nILLNESSES: \n Questionable kidney stone.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS: \n None.\n\n\nHABITS: \n No tobacco.

She has two sisters and one brother.  One sister interestingly has inflammatory arthritis.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \nNotable for fever, fatigue, blurred vision, rash and itching; her GI symptoms that were discussed in the HPI are actually resolved in that she started the gluten-free diet.  She also notes headaches, anxiety, heat and cold intolerance, excessive thirst and urination.

LYMPH:  No cervical lymphadenopathy.  EXTREMITIES: No edema.  No rash.  NEURO/PSYCH:  Orientation, memory, motor and gait are intact.\n\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: \n The patient is a 19-year-old female with what appears to be celiac sprue, that is markedly improved on a gluten-free diet.  I discussed with her and her mother that the gold standard really is a small bowel biopsy, but she would have to go back on her gluten diet to obtain the study.

I have given her a handout regarding celiac disease as well as a gluten-free diet and we will go ahead and obtain a small bowel follow through as it seems as if she has had symptoms for many years.  We will check a TSH as well as a CBC to make sure she is not anemic and secondary to the rectal bleeding and a sister with inflammatory arthritis, we will go ahead and check a flexible sigmoidoscopy to make sure there are no signs of inflammatory bowel disease.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[1020, 1026, "ANATOMY"], [1996, 2001, "ANATOMY"], [2028, 2033, "ANATOMY"], [2111, 2116, "ANATOMY"], [2252, 2263, "ANATOMY"], [2564, 2575, "ANATOMY"], [2913, 2924, "ANATOMY"], [80, 92, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [441, 453, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1290, 1304, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1382, 1404, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1647, 1651, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2146, 2166, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2183, 2203, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2225, 2249, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2429, 2441, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2834, 2848, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3119, 3141, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3230, 3256, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [204, 212, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [214, 226, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [228, 236, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [238, 244, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [256, 264, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [266, 274, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [276, 296, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [298, 320, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [342, 350, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [618, 626, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [684, 692, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [779, 791, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [994, 1003, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1441, 1446, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1448, 1455, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1473, 1477, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1498, 1506, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1618, 1627, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1665, 1681, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1709, 1717, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2268, 2273, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2279, 2283, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2970, 2978, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nREASON FOR ADMISSION: \n Cholecystitis with choledocholithiasis.\n\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: \n Cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis.\n\n\nADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES\n\n1.

She was admitted through the emergency room with abdominal pain, elevated bilirubin, and gallstones on ultrasound with a dilated common bile duct.  She subsequently went for a HIDA scan to rule out cholecystitis.  Gallbladder was filled but was unable to empty into the small bowel consistent with the common bile duct blockage.  She was taken to the operating room that night for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  We proceeded with laparoscopic cholecystectomy and during the cholangiogram there was no contrast.  It was able to be extravasated into the duodenum with the filling defect consistent with the distal common bile duct stone.  The patient had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but could not receive an ERCP and stone extraction, therefore, common bile duct exploration was performed and a stone was extracted.  This necessitated conversion to an open operation.  She was transferred to the medical surgical unit postoperatively.  She had a significant amount of incisional pain following morning, but no nausea.  A Jackson-Pratt drain, which was left in place in two places showed serosanguineous fluid.  White blood cell count was down to 7500 and bilirubin decreased to 2.1.  Next morning she was started on a liquid diet.  Foley catheter was discontinued.  There was no evidence of bile leak from the drains.  She was advanced to a regular diet on postoperative day #3, which was 12/09/07.  The following morning she was tolerating regular diet.  Her bowels had begun to function, and she was afebrile with her pain control with oral pain medications.  Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued from the wound.  The remaining Jackson-Pratt drain was left adjacent to her cystic duct.  Following morning, her laboratory studies were better.  Her bilirubin was down to normal and white blood cell count was normal with an H&amp;H of 9 and 26.3.  Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued, and she was discharged home.  Followup was in 3 days for staple removal.  She was given iron 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lortab elixir 15 cc p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. for pain.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[516, 532, "ANATOMY"], [670, 686, "ANATOMY"], [824, 840, "ANATOMY"], [909, 920, "ANATOMY"], [965, 976, "ANATOMY"], [997, 1013, "ANATOMY"], [1247, 1255, "ANATOMY"], [1307, 1323, "ANATOMY"], [1448, 1464, "ANATOMY"], [2162, 2168, "ANATOMY"], [2377, 2388, "ANATOMY"], [67, 80, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [86, 105, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [132, 145, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [147, 166, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [335, 346, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [394, 408, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [784, 794, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [893, 906, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [744, 758, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1670, 1685, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1712, 1718, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2222, 2226, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2240, 2249, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROBLEM:  \nChronic abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abnormal liver function tests.\n \n\nHISTORY: \n The patient is a 23-year-old female referred for evaluation due to a chronic history of abdominal pain and extensive work-up for abnormal liver function tests and this chronic nausea and vomiting referred here for further evaluation due to the patient's recent move from Eugene to Portland.  The patient is not a great historian.  Most of the history is obtained through the old history and chart that the patient has with her.  According to what we can make out, she began experiencing nausea, vomiting, recurrent epigastric and right upper quadrant pain in 2001.  She was initially seen by Dr. A back in September 2001 for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  During those times, it was suspected that part of her symptoms may be secondary to biliary disease and underwent a cholecystectomy performed in Oregon by Dr.  A in August 2001.  It was assumed that this was caused by biliary dyskinesia.  Previous to that, an upper endoscopy was performed by Dr. B in July 2001 that showed to be mild gastritis secondary to anti-inflammatory use.  Postoperatively she continued to have nausea and vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and epigastric pain similar to her gallbladder pain in the past.    In addition, she had significant abnormal liver function tests with ALT in the 600's, AST 300's with a bilirubin 2.5 and alkaline phosphatase in the 200's.  Ultrasound shows common bile duct of 6 mm post cholecystectomy.  The patient was then eventually referred to Dr. W in Oregon.  Given the abnormal liver function tests and abnormal ultrasound, Dr. W performed an ERCP with sphincterotomy  in September 20, 2001.  Because of the symptoms and the suspicions of Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, a sphincterotomy was performed during the ERCP.  Procedure was uneventful.  The patient did well for a few months, but unfortunately got hospitalized again in May 2002 for recurrence of the abdominal pain and markedly elevated liver function tests with ALT in the 600 to 900 range, again with nausea and vomiting.  After transient elevation, her liver function tests would normalize.  \n \nDuring her hospitalization, extensive work-up including CT scan, 24 hour urine collection for porphyrins, a percutaneous liver biopsy, and Hepatitis panel, all of which were normal.  A repeat ERCP with placement of endobiliary stent was uneventful and did not show evidence of PBC or PSC.  After placement of the biliary stent, according to Dr. W's note, it apparently helped the patient with her symptoms with decreased frequency of nausea, vomiting, and pain.  MRI of the abdomen was also performed in May 2002 showing a horseshoe kidney, which was previously known on old CT scans.  While the biliary stent was in place, the patient did have recurrent bouts of nausea and vomiting and pain rated 7 out of 10 in intensity.   Finally in August 2002, the endobiliary stent was removed and there were no signs of obstruction.  Thereafter, the patient actually did fairly well for about a year, but because of a recurrence of her symptoms, Dr. W actually sent the patient up to OHSU for evaluation of this continued fairly mysterious abdominal pain.  The patient states that she saw Dr. A who recommended some laboratory tests and a repeat ERCP for further evaluation, but the patient did not want to go up to OHSU as she was somewhat unhappy with initial care.  \n \nThen, over the course of the next several month, at the beginning of 2004, the patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and recurrence abdominal pain returned.  In fact, recently as the last documentation in May and June, the patient visited Emergency Room several times due to her symptoms.  Lab tests show normal CBC with no signs of elevated white count.  AST and ALT were normal.  Alkaline phosphatase was in the low 200's with minimally elevated lipase of 78.  Bilirubin was completely normal.  The patient was given some Zofran and that seemed to control her symptoms and then she was discharged and now referred to us for further evaluation.  At the present time, the patient is not having any abdominal pain.  She states she threw up three times in the morning and is feeling well at this point.  Her abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting symptoms are random.  It does not associate with food.  It is not pre or post meal and occasionally will wake her up in the middle of the night.  She has not lost any weight despite this chronic nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain.  Her bowel habits have been fairly normal.  No hematemesis or melena.  No rashes, joint pain, or other symptoms have been noted.  \n \n\nALLERGIES: \n The patient has allergies to Sulfa and Codeine.  \n\n\nOPERATIONS: \n Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, two ERCP's including stent placement and sphincterotomy.\n\n\nILLNESSES: \n Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for which Dr. B is following.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  \nThe patient is on some type of anti-inflammatory, for which the name is unknown to her.  She is also taking some Zofran.  \n\n\nHABITS: \n She does not drink or smoke.  \n \n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \n The patent moved up from Eugene.  She currently lives up here and works in Portland.  \n \n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n  Noncontributory.\n \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: \n The patient has seen primarily Dr. B, her rheumatologist, as primary care.\n \n\nDATA: \n The patient's extensive chart was reviewed.  It took over 45 minutes to sort through the chart and the labs. \n \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \n The patient is a  23-year old female who appears well developed with no acute signs of distress.  HENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, PERRLA, EOMI, sclerae are anicteric.  Nares are patent and symmetrical.  The oropharynx is clear with moist mucus membranes and no obvious mucosal lesions.  The tongue is midline.  NECK:  Supple without adenopathy, JVD, or thyromegaly.  There's no supraclavicular adenopathy.  LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally with normal respiratory effort.  BACK:  Nontender to palpation and there's no CVA tenderness or obvious spinal deformity.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended and nontender to palpation throughout with no appreciable hepatosplenomegaly, masses, fullness or ascites.  Bowel sounds were present and did appear normal.  RECTAL:  Deferred.  EXTREMITIES:  Without edema, calf tenderness or joint swelling.  NEUROLOGIC:  Shows the patient to be alert and oriented x's 3 with normal gait.  SKIN:  Warm and dry with normal color and no rashes. \n \n\nIMPRESSION: \n A 23-year-old female with fairly mysterious symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain status post cholecystectomy and ERCP with sphincterotomy.  She continues to have very intermittent elevated liver function tests and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  There was some discussion with Dr. W in the past regarding extending the sphincterotomy to ensure that a complete sphincterotomy was performed if the patient should have sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, however, at this time I am reluctant to do so without further reviewing the patient's chart and investigating other avenues.  I think we will check another repeat liver function test and I think it may be helpful to repeat a liver biopsy to ensure we are not missing other primary liver diseases before concentrating purely on the biliary tree itself.  In addition, AMA will be obtained along with a liver function test.  I would also like to obtain some discharge summaries from Dr. W's office to further clarify what has transpired over the past three years.  \n \n\nPLAN:  \n\n1.  Obtain discharge summaries from Dr. W's office.\n2.  Send the patient for a complete metabolic panel, AMA.\n3.  Send the patient for ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided liver biopsy.\n4.  The patient will return to see me in three weeks.  We will consider further options pending on these results of the test and review of the patient's discharge summaries from Dr. W's office.  If the patient should show symptoms of pain and elevated liver function tests to be consistent with Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, we may repeat the ERCP and extend the sphincterotomy.  The entire case was discussed with the patient.  The patient is agreeable to the current plan.

She was referred for a screening colonoscopy.  The patient has bowel movements every other day.  There is no blood in the stool, no abdominal pain.  She has hypertension, dyslipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.  She has had cesarean section twice in the past.  Physical examination is unremarkable.  There is no family history of colon cancer.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Diverticulosis.\n\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL: \n Procedure and possible complications were explained to the patient.  Ample opportunity was provided to her to ask questions.  Informed consent was obtained.  She was placed in left lateral position.  Inspection of perianal area was normal.  Digital exam of the rectum was normal.\n\nVideo Olympus colonoscope was introduced into the rectum.  The sigmoid colon is very tortuous.  The instrument was advanced to the cecum after placing the patient in a supine position.  The patient was well prepared and a good examination was possible.  The cecum was identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice.  Images were taken.  The instrument was then gradually withdrawn while examining the colon again in a circumferential manner.  Few diverticula were encountered in the sigmoid and descending colon.  Retroflex view of the rectum was unremarkable.  No polyps or malignancy was identified.\n\nAfter obtaining images, the air was suctioned.  Instrument was withdrawn from the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS:  \nColonoscopy was performed to cecum and demonstrates the following:\n1.  Mild-to-moderate diverticulosis.\n2.  \n\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n\n1.  The patient was provided information on diverticulosis including dietary advice.\n2.

He is taking it at a dose of 100 mg per day.  He is status post resection of the terminal ileum and has experienced intermittent obstructive symptoms for the past several years.  In fact, he had an episode three weeks ago in which he was seen at the emergency room after experiencing sudden onset of abdominal pain and vomiting. An x-ray was performed, which showed no signs of obstruction per his report.  He thinks that the inciting factor of this incident was too many grapes eaten the day before.  He has had similar symptoms suggestive of obstruction when eating oranges or other high-residue fruits in the past.  The patient's normal bowel pattern is loose stools and this is unchanged recently.  He has not had any rectal bleeding. He asks today about a rope-like vein on his anterior right arm that has been a little tender and enlarged after he was in the emergency room and they had difficulty with IV insertion.  He has not had any fever, red streaking up the arm, or enlargement of lymph nodes.  The tenderness has now completely resolved.  \n \nHe had a colonoscopy performed in August of 2003, by Dr. S.  An anastomotic stricture was found at the terminal ileum/cecum junction.  Dr. S recommended that if the patient experienced crampy abdominal pain or other symptoms of obstruction, that he may consider balloon dilation.  No active Crohn's disease was found during the colonoscopy.  \n \nEarlier this year, he experienced a non-specific hepatitis with elevation of his liver function tests.  At that time he was taking a lot of Tylenol for migraine-type headaches.  Under Dr. S's recommendation, he stopped the Imuran for one month and reduced his dose of Tylenol.  Since that time his liver enzymes have normalized and he has restarted the Imuran with no problems.  \n \nHe also reports heartburn that is occurring on a slightly more frequent basis than it has in the past.  It used to occur once a week only, but has now increased in frequency to twice a week.  He takes over-the-counter H2 blockers as needed, as well as Tums.  He associates the onset of his symptoms with eating spicy Mexican food.\n \n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: \n Reviewed and unchanged.\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n No known allergies to medications.\n\n\nOPERATIONS: \n Unchanged.\n\n\nILLNESSES: \n Crohn's disease, vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n  Imuran, Nascobal, Vicodin p.r.n.\n \n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: \n Dated 08/04/04 is reviewed and noted.  Please see pertinent GI issues as discussed above.  Otherwise unremarkable.\n \n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  \n GENERAL:  Pleasant male in no acute distress.  Well nourished and well developed. SKIN: indurated, cord-like superficial vein on the right anterior forearm, approx. 3 cm in length.  Non-tender to palpation. No erythema or red streaking.  No edema. LYMPH:  No epitrochlear or axillary lymph node enlargement or tenderness on the right side. \n \nDATA REVIEWED: Labs from June 8th and July 19th reviewed.  Liver function tests normal with AST 14 and ALT 44.  WBCs were slightly low at 4.8.  Hemoglobin dropped slightly from 14.1 on 6/8 to 12.9 on 7/19. Hematocrit dropped slightly as well from 43.2 on 6/804 to 40.0 on 7/19/04.  These results were reviewed by Dr. S and lab results letter sent.\n \n\nIMPRESSION:  \n\n1. Crohn's disease, status post terminal ileum resection, on Imuran.  Intermittent symptoms of bowel obstruction.  Last episode three weeks ago.\n2.  History of non-specific hepatitis while taking high doses of Tylenol.  Now resolved. \n2.  Increased frequency of reflux symptoms.\n3.  Superficial thrombophlebitis, resolving. \n4.  Slightly low H&amp;H.\n \n\nPLAN:  \n\n1.  We discussed Dr. S's recommendation that the patient undergo balloon dilation for recurrent bowel obstruction type symptoms.  The patient emphatically states that he does not want to consider dilation at this time.  The patient is strongly encouraged to call us when he does experience any obstructive symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel habits.  He states understanding of this. Advised to maintain low residue diet to avoid obstructions. \n2.  Continue with liver panel and ABC every month per Dr. S's instructions.\n3.  Continue Imuran 100 mg per day.\n4.  Continue to minimize Tylenol use.  The patient is wondering if he can take another type of medication for migraines that is not Tylenol or antiinflammatories or aspirin.  Dr. S is consulted and agrees that Imitrex is an acceptable alternative for migraine headaches since he does not have advanced liver disease. The patient will make an appointment with his primary care provider to discuss this further. \n5.  Reviewed the importance of prophylactic treatment of reflux-type symptoms.  Encouraged the patient to take over-the-counter H2 blockers on a daily basis to prevent symptoms from occurring.  The patient will try this and if he remains symptomatic, then he will call our office and a prescription for Zantac 150 mg per day will be provided.  Reviewed the potential need for upper endoscopy should his symptoms continue or become more frequent.  He does not want to undergo any type of procedure such as that at this time.\n6.    His thrombophlebitis appears to be resolving and does not have any alarming features present.  No treatment is needed at this time. He is instructed to call our office or his PCP if he experiences any pain, red streaking or fever. \n7.  We will watch his CBC carefully to ensure that the H&amp;H does not continue to drop.

After admission, she had a CT of the abdomen done, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis and she was started on IV Flagyl and also on IV Levaquin.  She was also placed on IV Reglan because of nausea and vomiting.  In spite of the above, her white count still continues to be elevated today.  On questioning the patient, she states the nausea and vomiting has resolved, but the diarrhea still present, but otherwise denies any other specific complaints except for some weakness.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: \n Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recent C. diff colitis, which had resolved based on speaking to Dr. X.  Two weeks ago, he had seen the patient and she was clinically well.\n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  \nNoncontributory.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  \nNo history of smoking, alcohol, or drug use.  She lives at home.\n\n\nHOME MEDICATIONS:  \nShe is on atenolol and Mevacor.\n\nALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  \nPositive for diarrhea and abdominal pain, otherwise main other complaints are weakness.  She denies any cough, sputum production, or dysuria at this time.  Otherwise, a 10-system review is essentially negative.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM:\n\nGENERAL:  She is awake and alert, currently in no apparent distress.\nVITAL SIGNS:  She has been afebrile since admission, temperature today 96.5, heart rate 80, respirations 18, blood pressure 125/60, and O2 sat is 98% on 2 L.\nHEENT:  Pupils are round and reactive to light and accommodation.\nCHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 are present.  No rales appreciated.\nABDOMEN:  She does have tenderness to palpation all over with some mild rebound tenderness also.  No guarding noted.  Bowel sounds present.\nEXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.\n\nCT of the abdomen and pelvis is also reviewed on the computer, which showed evidence of diffuse colitis.\n\n\nLABORATORY: \n White blood cell count today 21.5, hemoglobin 12.4, platelet count 284,000, and neutrophils 89.  UA on 6/18/2009 showed no evidence of UTI.  Sodium today 130, potassium 2.7, and creatinine 0.4.  AST and ALT on 6/20/2009 were normal.  Blood cultures from admission were negative.  Urine culture on admission was negative.  C. diff was positive.  Stool culture was negative.\n\n\nASSESSMENT:\n\n1.  A 72-year-old female with Clostridium difficile colitis.\n2.  Diarrhea secondary to above and also could be related Reglan, which was discontinued today.\n3.  Leukocytosis secondary to above, mild improvement today though.\n4.  Bilateral pleural effusion by CT of the chest, although could represent thickening.\n5.  New requirement for oxygen, rule out pneumonia.\n6.  Hypertension.\n\n\nPLAN:\n\n1.  Treat the C. diff aggressively especially given CT appearance and her continued leukocytosis and because of the Levaquin, which could have added additional antibiotic pressure, so I will restart the IV Flagyl.\n2.  Continue p.o. vancomycin.  Add Florastor to help replenish the gut flora.\n3.  Monitor WBCs closely and follow clinically and if there is any deterioration in her clinical status, I would recommend getting surgical evaluation immediately for surgery if needed.\n4.

Urine shows positive glucose, but negative for nitrite and creatinine was 7.1, sodium 131, potassium was 5.2, and lipase and amylase were normal.  So, the patient admitted to the Med/Surg floor initially and the patient was started on IV fluid as well as low-dose IV antibiotic and 2-D echocardiogram and EKG also was ordered.  The patient also had history of CHF in the past and recently had some workup done.  The patient does not remember initially.  Surgical consult also requested and blood culture and urine culture also ordered.  The same day, the patient was seen by Dr. Y and the patient should need cholecystectomy, but the patient also needs dialysis and also needs to be cleared by the cardiologist, so the patient later on seen by Dr. Z and cleared the patient for the surgery with moderate risk and the patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  The patient also seen by nephrologist and underwent dialysis.  The patient's white count went down 6.1, afebrile.  On postop day #1, the patient started eating and also walking.

The patient has had anorexia with decrease in appetite.  His physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 102.4.  He had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with Rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen.  The patient was presumed acute appendicitis and was placed on IV antibiotics and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed.\n\n\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS: \n Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum.  There was large amounts of purulent drainage.  The appendix was visualized, however, it was difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema.  It was decided given the signs of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy.  Upon exploration of the ileum, there was noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this was resected.  Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy was performed.  The patient was irrigated with copious amounts of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters.  The patient was closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure.  He remained ventilated and was placed on a large amount of ________.  His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care.\n\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:\n  The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously.  The patient was intubated by the Anesthesia Department.  After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision was created.  The Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen.  The abdomen was insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg.  A #10 mm ablated trocar was inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope was inserted and the abdomen was explored and the above findings were noted.  A right upper quadrant 5 mm port was inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix.  Decision was then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the signs of acute perforation.  The instruments were then removed.  The abdomen was then deflated.  Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision was created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis.\n\nThe incision was carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding was controlled along the way with electrocautery.  The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum was opened carefully with the scissors as the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy.  Incision was carried down to the midline within the linea alba.  Once the abdomen was opened, there was noted to be gross purulent drainage.  The ileum was explored and there was noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum.  Decision to resect the diverticulum was performed.\n\nThe blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl was used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum.  Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The Meckel's diverticulum was noted to be completely free and was grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum was transected.  There was noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage.  Next, decision was decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy.  Mesoappendix was doubly clamped with hemostats and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  The appendiceal artery was identified and was clamped between two hemostats and transected as well.  Once the appendix was completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion.  A plain gut was placed at the base of the appendix and tied down.  The appendix was milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway.  A second piece of plain gut suture was used to ligate above and then was transected with a #10 blade scalpel.  The appendiceal stump was then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Once the ________ was completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant was performed.  The drain was positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall.  It was sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of warmed normal saline.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable for pathology.  The omentum was replaced over the bowel contents and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascias were closed with a running suture.  Once the abdomen was completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the incision was closed with staples.  The previous laparoscopic sites were also closed with staples.  Sterile dressings were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs.  JPs replaced with bulb suction.  NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place.  The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case.\n\nThe patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course.

At the patient's bedside after obtaining an informed consent, the patient's right deltopectoral area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated and with the patient in Trendelenburg position, she had her right subclavian vein percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  A Seldinger technique was used and a triple-lumen catheter was inserted.  There was a good flow through all three ports, which were irrigated with saline prior to connection to the IV solutions.\n\nThe catheter was affixed to the skin with sutures and then a dressing was applied.\n\nThe postprocedure chest x-ray revealed that there were no complications to the procedure and that the catheter was in good place.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[71, 76, "ANATOMY"], [148, 153, "ANATOMY"], [262, 283, "ANATOMY"], [353, 358, "ANATOMY"], [722, 743, "ANATOMY"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Abdominal mass.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Abdominal mass.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:\n  Paracentesis.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nThis 64-year-old female has stage II endometrial carcinoma, which had been resected before and treated with chemotherapy and radiation.  At the present time, the patient is under radiation treatment.  Two weeks ago or so, she developed a large abdominal mass, which was cystic in nature and the radiologist inserted a pigtail catheter in the emergency room.  We proceeded to admit the patient and drained a significant amount of clear fluid in the subsequent days.  The cytology of the fluid was negative and the culture was also negative.  Eventually, the patient was sent home with the pigtail shut off and the patient a week later underwent a repeat CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.\n\nThe CAT scan showed accumulation of the fluid and the mass almost achieving 80% of the previous size.  Therefore, I called the patient home and she came to the emergency department where the service was provided.  At that time, I proceeded to work on the pigtail catheter after obtaining an informed consent and preparing and draping the area in the usual fashion.  Unfortunately, the catheter was open.

The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula.  Recommendation for a surgery was made.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter.  They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure.  All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking.\n\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS: \n The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic.  An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia.  The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery.\n\nOnce within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall.  At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad.  The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen.  The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation.  At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess.  When the small bowel was completely freed of  abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus.  The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized.  At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum.  At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed.  Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired.  The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology.  Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis.  A pursestring device was fired.  The staple line was cut.  The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied.  At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced.  The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient.  \n\nImmediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom.  It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches.  Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air.  No air was seen evolving from the staple line.  All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken.  The scope was removed at this point.  The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula.  Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon.  After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again.  More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area.  The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.\n\nThis incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin.  The wire was passed under the transverse colon.  It was left in place.  Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis.  At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied.  Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue.  Copious amount of irrigation was used.  The skin was approximated with staples.  At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made.  The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge.  One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened.  As previously mentioned, the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a #3-0 nylon suture.  The JP was secured with #3-0 nylon suture as well.  At this point, dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The stent from the left ureter was removed and the Foley was left in place.  The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed up during the hospitalization.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[241, 246, "ANATOMY"], [411, 414, "ANATOMY"], [506, 513, "ANATOMY"], [1306, 1311, "ANATOMY"], [1631, 1642, "ANATOMY"], [1679, 1693, "ANATOMY"], [1725, 1736, "ANATOMY"], [1829, 1845, "ANATOMY"], [2004, 2015, "ANATOMY"], [2062, 2073, "ANATOMY"], [2120, 2127, "ANATOMY"], [2155, 2161, "ANATOMY"], [2270, 2277, "ANATOMY"], [2321, 2328, "ANATOMY"], [2413, 2420, "ANATOMY"], [2433, 2439, "ANATOMY"], [2505, 2514, "ANATOMY"], [2608, 2615, "ANATOMY"], [2681, 2697, "ANATOMY"], [2702, 2709, "ANATOMY"], [2802, 2814, "ANATOMY"], [3022, 3038, "ANATOMY"], [3336, 3340, "ANATOMY"], [3350, 3356, "ANATOMY"], [3561, 3568, "ANATOMY"], [3849, 3853, "ANATOMY"], [4136, 4143, "ANATOMY"], [4234, 4239, "ANATOMY"], [4489, 4495, "ANATOMY"], [4713, 4729, "ANATOMY"], [4762, 4778, "ANATOMY"], [4836, 4852, "ANATOMY"], [4988, 4994, "ANATOMY"], [5050, 5056, "ANATOMY"], [5679, 5691, "ANATOMY"], [6022, 6033, "ANATOMY"], [69, 88, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [122, 141, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [147, 170, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [569, 588, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2043, 2050, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2099, 2106, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2168, 2175, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4175, 4182, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4211, 4225, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [5014, 5021, "DISEASESYNDROME"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.

On evaluation, it was noted that the patient has clinical findings consistent with acute appendicitis.  However, the patient with additional history of loose stools for several days prior to event.  Therefore, a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained revealing findings consistent with acute appendicitis.  There was no evidence of colitis on the CAT scan.  With this in mind and the patient's continued pain at present, the patient was explained the risks and benefits of appendectomy.  She agreed to procedure and informed consent was obtained.\n\n\nGROSS FINDINGS: \n The appendix was removed without difficulty with laparoscopic approach.  The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it.  There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix.\n\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS:\n  The patient was placed in supine position.  After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision.  Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg.  The Veress needle was then removed.  A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen.  A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation.  Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation.  Photodocumentation was obtained.\n\nA 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant.  This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix.  Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization.  Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix.  Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix.  Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples.  Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure.  Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it.  The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site.  The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated.  The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic.  Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear.  There was a small adhesion appreciated in the region of the surgical site.  This was taken down with blunt dissection without difficulty.  There was no evidence of other areas of disease.  Upon re-exploration with a video laparoscope in the abdomen and after this noting the appendix base to be hemostatic and intact.  The instruments were removed from the patient and the port sites were then taken off under direct visualization.

This patient presented with periumbilical abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past 3 days and four to five watery bowel movements a day with symptoms progressively getting worse.  The patient was admitted into the ER and had trop x1 done, which was negative and ECG showed to be of normal sinus rhythm.\n\nLab findings initially presented with a hemoglobin of 13.1, hematocrit of 38.6 with no elevation of white count.  Upon discharge, his hemoglobin and hematocrit stayed at 10.9 and 31.3 and he was still having stool guaiac positive blood, and a stool study was done which showed few white blood cells, negative for Clostridium difficile and moderate amount of occult blood and moderate amount of RBCs.  The patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea did resolve during his hospital course.  Was placed on IV fluids initially and on hospital day #2 fluids were discontinued and was started on clear liquid diet and diet was advanced slowly, and the patient was able to tolerate p.o. well.  The patient also denied any abdominal pain upon day of discharge.  The patient was also started on prednisone as per GI recommendations.  He was started on 60 mg p.o.  Amylase and lipase were also done which were normal and LDH and CRP was also done which are also normal and LFTs were done which were also normal as well.\n\n\nPLAN: \n The plan is to discharge the patient home.  He can resume his home medications of Prandin, Actos, Lipitor, Glucophage, Benicar, and Advair.  We will also start him on a tapered dose of prednisone for 4 weeks.  We will start him on 15 mg p.o. for seven days.  Then, week #2, we will start him on 40 mg for 1 week.  Then, week #3, we will start him on 30 mg for 1 week, and then, 20 mg for 1 week, and then finally we will stop.

Prior to sedation, informed consent was obtained.  Risks, benefits, and alternatives including, but not limited to risk of bleeding, infection, perforation, adverse reaction to medication, failure to identify pathology, pancreatitis, and death explained to the patient and his wife, who accepted all risks.  The patient was prepped in the left lateral position.  IV sedation was given to a total of fentanyl 100 mcg and midazolam 4 mg for the initial EGD.  An additional 50 mcg of fentanyl and 2 mg of midazolam were given following erythromycin.  Scope tip of the Olympus gastroscope was passed into the esophagus.  Proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the esophagus were well visualized.  There was fresh blood in the esophagus, which was washed thoroughly, but no source was seen.  No evidence of varices was seen.  The stomach was entered.  The stomach was filled with very large clot and fresh blood and liquid, which could not be suctioned due to the clot burden.  There was a small amount of bright red blood near the fundus, but a source could not be identified due to the clot burden.  Because of this, the gastroscope was withdrawn.  The patient was given 250 mg of erythromycin in the Emergency Department and 30 minutes later, the scope was repassed.  On the second look, the esophagus was cleared.  The liquid gastric contents were cleared.  There was still a moderate amount of clot burden in the stomach, but no active bleeding was seen.  There was a small grade I esophageal varices, but no stigmata of bleed.  There was also a small amount of fresh blood within the hiatal hernia, but no source of bleeding was identified.  The patient was hemodynamically stable; therefore, a decision was made for a second look in the morning.  The scope was withdrawn and air was suctioned.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery without immediate complications.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[280, 287, "ANATOMY"], [319, 325, "ANATOMY"], [1485, 1494, "ANATOMY"], [1540, 1549, "ANATOMY"], [1602, 1611, "ANATOMY"], [1705, 1712, "ANATOMY"], [1731, 1738, "ANATOMY"], [1907, 1913, "ANATOMY"], [2170, 2179, "ANATOMY"], [2293, 2300, "ANATOMY"], [178, 184, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [201, 210, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [215, 222, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [436, 446, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [529, 542, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1100, 1112, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1682, 1689, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2362, 2372, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2465, 2478, "DISEASESYNDROME"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nHISTORY:\n  Reason for ICU followup today is acute anemia secondary to upper GI bleeding with melena with dropping hemoglobin from 11 to 8, status post transfusion of 2 units PRBCs with EGD performed earlier today by Dr. X of Gastroenterology confirming diagnosis of ulcerative esophagitis, also for continuing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with productive cough, infection and shortness of breath.  Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient.  Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value.  He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X.  I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding.  Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future.  The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU.  He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nVITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8.  Is and Os negative fluid balance of 1.4 liters in the last 24 hours.\nGENERAL:  This is a somnolent 68-year-old male, who arouses to voice, wakes up, seems to have good appetite, has continuing cough.  Pallor is improved.\nEYES:  Conjunctivae are now pink.\nENT:  Oropharynx is clear.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Reveals distant heart tones with regular rate and rhythm.\nLUNGS:  Have coarse breath sounds with wheezes, rhonchi, and soft crackles in the bases.\nABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no organomegaly appreciated.\nEXTREMITIES:  Showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Capillary refill time is now normal in the fingertips.\nNEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits.\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA:\n  Laboratories drawn at 1449 today, WBC 10, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11.5 and 33.1, and platelets 288,000.  This is up from 8.6 and 24.7.  Platelets are stable.  Sodium is 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarb 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, glucose 73, calcium 8.4, INR 0.96, iron 13%, saturations 4%, TIBC 312, TSH 0.74, CEA elevated at 8.6, ferritin 27.5 and occult blood positive.  EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time.\n\n\nIMPRESSION/PLAN\n\n1.  Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis.  We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding.  If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.\n2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The patient is doing well, taking PO.  We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments.  We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions.  This does appear to be improving.  His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications.\n3.  Elevated CEA.  The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis.  He has refused this today.  We would like to encourage him to do so.  Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion.  Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors.\n4.  Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity.  This appears to be anemia of chronic disease.  However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding.  Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[1540, 1545, "ANATOMY"], [1798, 1802, "ANATOMY"], [1892, 1897, "ANATOMY"], [1934, 1939, "ANATOMY"], [2086, 2097, "ANATOMY"], [2140, 2149, "ANATOMY"], [2210, 2224, "ANATOMY"], [93, 99, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [309, 319, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [353, 390, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [943, 953, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1381, 1391, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1401, 1412, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2779, 2789, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2892, 2902, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3191, 3228, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3247, 3284, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4164, 4170, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4254, 4260, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4311, 4326, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4489, 4501, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [420, 425, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [441, 460, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [931, 939, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1161, 1180, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1185, 1193, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1209, 1214, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1455, 1461, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1466, 1474, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1770, 1775, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1973, 1980, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2110, 2118, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2120, 2128, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2132, 2137, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n  History of perforated sigmoid diverticuli with Hartmann's procedure.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  \n\n1.

Recommendation for reversal of the colostomy was made after more than six months from the previous surgery for a sigmoid colon resection and Hartmann's colostomy.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room placed into lithotomy position after being prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A cystoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra and to the bladder.  Immediately, no evidence of cystitis was seen and the scope was introduced superiorly, measuring the bladder and immediately a #5 French ____ was introduced within the left urethra.  The cystoscope was removed, a Foley was placed, and wide connection was placed attaching the left ureteral stent and Foley.  At this point, immediately the patient was re-prepped and draped and immediately after the ostomy was closed with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, immediately at this point, the abdominal wall was opened with a #10 blade Bard-Parker down with electrocautery for complete hemostasis through the midline.\n\nThe incision scar was cephalad due to the severe adhesions in the midline.  Once the abdomen was entered in the epigastric area, then massive lysis of adhesions was performed to separate the small bowel from the anterior abdominal wall.  Once the small bowel was completely free from the anterior abdominal wall, at this point, the ostomy was taken down with an elliptical incision with cautery and then meticulous dissection with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal wall, where a meticulous dissection was carried with Metzenbaum scissors to separate the entire ostomy from the abdominal wall.  Immediately at this point, the bowel was dropped within the abdominal cavity, and more lysis of adhesions was performed cleaning the left gutter area to mobilize the colon further down to have no tension in the anastomosis.  At this point, the rectal stump, where two previous sutures with Prolene were seen, were brought with hemostats.  The rectal stump was free in a 360 degree fashion and immediately at this point, a decision to perform the anastomosis was made.  First, a self-retaining retractor was introduced in the abdominal cavity and a bladder blade was introduced as well.  Blue towel was placed above the small bowel retracting the bowel to cephalad and at this point, immediately the rectal stump was well visualized, no evidence of bleeding was seen, and the towels were placed along the edges of the abdominal wound.  Immediately, the pursestring device was fired approximately 1 inch from the skin and on the descending colon, this was fired.  The remainder of the excess tissue was closed with Metzenbaum scissors and immediately after dilating #25 and #29 mushroom tip from the T8 Ethicon was placed within the colon and then #9-0 suture was tied.  Immediately from the anus, the dilator #25 and #29 was introduced dilating the rectum.  The #29 EEA was introduced all the way anteriorly to the staple line and this spike from the EEA was used to perforate the rectum and then the mushroom from the descending colon was attached to it.  The EEA was then fired.  Once it was fired and was removed, the pelvis was filled with fluid.  Immediately both doughnuts were ____ from the anastomosis.  A Doyen was placed in both the anastomosis.  Colonoscope was introduced.  No bubble or air was seen coming from the anastomosis.  There was no evidence of bleeding.  Pictures of the anastomosis were taken.  The scope then was removed from the patient's rectum.  Copious amount of irrigation was used within the peritoneal cavity.  Immediately at this point, all complete sponge and instrument count was performed.  First, the ostomy site was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl suture.  The peritoneum was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture.  Then, the midline incision was closed with a loop PDS in cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad tight in the middle.  Subq tissue was copiously irrigated and the staples on the skin.\n\nThe iodoform packing was placed within the old ostomy site and then the staples on the skin as well.  The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed during the hospitalization.  The left ureteral stent was removed at the end of the procedure.  _____ were performed.  Lysis of adhesions were performed.

The hernia mass had been marked preoperatively.  This area was anesthetized with a mixture of Marcaine and Xylocaine.  A transverse incision was made over the hernia and dissection carried down to the entrapped fat.  Sharp dissection was carried around the fat down to the fascial edge.  The preperitoneal fat could not be reduced; therefore, it is trimmed away and the small fascial defect then closed with interrupted 0-Ethibond sutures.  The fascial edges were injected with the local anesthetic mixture.  Subcutaneous tissues were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl and skin edges closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Vicryl.

He apparently had an NG tube placed in the emergency room with gastric aspirate revealing no blood.  Dr. Y Miller saw him in consultation and recommended a colonoscopy.  A bowel prep was done.  H&amp;Hs were stable.  His most recent H&amp;H was 38.6/13.2 that was this morning.  His H&amp;H at admission was 41/14.3.  The patient had the bowel prep that revealed no significant bleeding.  His vital signs are stable.  He is continuing on his usual medications of Imdur, metoprolol, and Synthroid.  His Plavix is discontinued.  He is given IV Protonix.  I am hesitant to use Prilosec or Protonix because of his history of pancreatitis associated with Prilosec.\n\nThe patient's PT/INR was 1.03, PTT 25.8.  Chemistry panel was unremarkable.  The patient was given a regular diet after his colonoscopy today.  He tolerated it well and is being discharged home.  He will be followed closely as an outpatient.  He will continue his Pepcid 40 mg at night, Imdur, Synthroid, and metoprolol as prior to admission.  He will hold his Plavix for now.

Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, interpretation.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General anesthesia.\n\n\nINDICATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE: \n The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of chronic esophageal stricture who is admitted with food sticking and retching.  He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy.\n\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: \n After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room.  He was placed in a supine position on the operating table.  After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll.  Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion.  After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace.  The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered.  The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure.  The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed.\n\nImmediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid.  Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis.  The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.  A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed.  There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity.  The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored.  The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus.  It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area.  The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair.  After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French.  These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk.\n\nThe intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures.  Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures.  The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples.\n\nThe patient was then turned and placed in a supine position.  A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed.  A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced.  The laparoscope was introduced.  A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced.  It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance.  The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely.  The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique.  Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire.  #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated.  We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall.  The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position.  As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Aspiration demonstrated gastric content.\n\nGastrostomy tube study, with interpretation.  Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, with   interpretation:\n\nA gastric contrast study was then performed.\n\nApproximately 25 mL Gastrografin was introduced into the gastric lumen.  The abdominal films then demonstrated intragastric content with no extravasation.  After final inspection, the trocars were removed, the trocar sites were irrigated and closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures.  Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied.  Needle, sponge and instrument counts correct.\n\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  \nMinimal.\n\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: \n None.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[1360, 1369, "ANATOMY"], [1482, 1491, "ANATOMY"], [1973, 1982, "ANATOMY"], [2017, 2026, "ANATOMY"], [2101, 2110, "ANATOMY"], [2202, 2206, "ANATOMY"], [2442, 2451, "ANATOMY"], [2622, 2632, "ANATOMY"], [3421, 3428, "ANATOMY"], [3531, 3545, "ANATOMY"], [3571, 3583, "ANATOMY"], [3726, 3733, "ANATOMY"], [3849, 3856, "ANATOMY"], [3999, 4011, "ANATOMY"], [4029, 4043, "ANATOMY"], [69, 79, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [118, 128, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [229, 239, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [266, 276, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [543, 553, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [621, 631, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1027, 1036, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2993, 3009, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [603, 611, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  protein-calorie malnutrition.\n2.

She has been hospitalized multiple times for intractable nausea and vomiting and dehydration.  She states that her decreased p.o. intake has been progressively worsening.  She was admitted to the service of Dr. Lang and was evaluated by Dr. Wickless as well all of whom agreed that the best option for supplemental nutrition for this patient was placement of a PEG tube.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n After risks, complications, and benefits were explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room.  She was placed in the supine position.  The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  After adequate IV sedation was obtained by anesthesia, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed.  The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were visualized without difficulty.  There was no gross evidence of any malignancy.  There was some enterogastritis which was noted upon exam.  The appropriate location was noted on the anterior wall of the stomach.  This area was localized externally with 1% lidocaine.  Large gauge needle was used to enter the lumen of the stomach under visualization.  A guide wire was then passed again under visualization and the needle was subsequently removed.  A scalpel was used to make a small incision, next to the guidewire and ensuring that the underlying fascia was nicked as well.  A dilator with break-away sheath was then inserted over the guidewire and under direct visualization was seen to enter the lumen of the stomach without difficulty.  The guidewire and dilator were then removed again under visualization and the PEG tube was placed through the break-away sheath and visualized within the lumen of the stomach.  The balloon was then insufflated and the break-away sheath was then pulled away.  Proper placement of the tube was ensured through visualization with a scope.  The tube was then sutured into place using nylon suture.  Appropriate sterile dressing was applied.\n\n\nDISPOSITION:  \nThe patient was transferred to the recovery in a stable condition.  She was subsequently returned to her room on the General Medical Floor.  Previous orders will be resumed.  We will instruct the Nursing that the PEG tube can be used at 5 p.m. this evening for medications if necessary and bolus feedings.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[1313, 1322, "ANATOMY"], [1324, 1331, "ANATOMY"], [1337, 1345, "ANATOMY"], [1553, 1560, "ANATOMY"], [1672, 1679, "ANATOMY"], [2063, 2070, "ANATOMY"], [2259, 2266, "ANATOMY"], [80, 100, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [140, 149, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [191, 211, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [251, 260, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [657, 668, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [118, 124, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [229, 235, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [633, 639, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [644, 652, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n1.

She has a previous history of hiatal hernia.  She was on Prevacid currently.  At this time, an EGD was performed to rule out stricture.  At the time of EGD, there was noted some antral gastritis and hiatal hernia.  There are no strictures, tumors, masses, or varices present.\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite in the lateral decubitus position.  She was given sedation by the Department Of Anesthesia.  Once adequate sedation was reached, the Olympus gastroscope was inserted into oropharynx.  With air insufflation entered through the proximal esophagus to the GE junction.  The esophagus was without evidence of tumors, masses, ulcerations, esophagitis, strictures, or varices.  There was a hiatal hernia present.  The scope was passed through the hiatal hernia into the body of the stomach.  In the distal antrum, there was some erythema with patchy erythematous changes with small superficial erosions.  Multiple biopsies were obtained.  The scope was passed through the pylorus into the duodenal bulb and duodenal suite, they appeared within normal limits.  The scope was pulled back from the stomach, retroflexed upon itself, _____ fundus and GE junction.  As stated, multiple biopsies were obtained.\n\nThe scope was then slowly withdrawn.

The patient presented later that evening after having increasing abdominal pain, fever and chills at home with a temperature up to 101.2.  The patient denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  She does complain of some frequent urination.  Her vaginal bleeding is minimal.\n\n\nFINDINGS: \n On bimanual exam, the uterus is approximately 6-week size, anteverted, and freely mobile with no adnexal masses appreciated.  On laparoscopic exam, there is a small hemostatic perforation noted on the left posterior aspect of the uterus.  There is approximately 40 cc of serosanguineous fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.  There is no evidence of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac or along the bladder flap.  There is no evidence of injury to the bowel or pelvic sidewall.  The liver margin, gallbladder and remainder of the bowel including the appendix appeared normal.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the Operating Room where general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterine manipulator was then placed into the patient's cervix and the vulsellum tenaculum and sterile speculum were removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  Veress needle was placed through this incision and the gas turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision.  The camera was placed with the above findings noted.  A 5 mm step trocar was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline.  A blunt probe was placed through this trocar to help for visualization of the pelvic and abdominal organs.  The serosanguineous fluid of the cul-de-sac was aspirated and the pelvis was copiously irrigated with sterile saline.  At this point, Dr. X was consulted.  He performed a rigid sigmoidoscopy, please see his dictation for further details.  There does not appear to be any evidence of colonic injury.  The saline in the pelvis was then suctioned out using Nezhat-Dorsey.  All instruments were removed.  The 5 mm trocar was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted.  The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate.  The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar removed.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision sites for postoperative pain relief.  Steri-Strips were then placed across the incision.  The uterine manipulator was then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure.

The patient is also diabetic.  The patient had a workup for her gallbladder, which showed evidence of biliary dyskinesia.  The patient was then scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia.\n\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: \n The patient's abdomen was explored.  There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding or masses.  The abdomen was otherwise within normal limits.  The gallbladder was easily visualized.  There was an intrahepatic gallbladder.  There was no evidence of any inflammatory change.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:\n  After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought into the operating suite.\n\nAfter general endotracheal intubation, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Next, an infraumbilical incision was made with a #10 scalpel.  The skin was elevated with towel clips and a Veress needle was inserted.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg of pressure.  The Veress needle was removed and a #10 blade trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The laparoscope was then inserted through this #10 port and the abdomen was explored.  There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding.  The peritoneum was smooth.  The gallbladder was intrahepatic somewhat.  No evidence of any inflammatory change.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the abdomen.  Next, attention was made to placing the epigastric #10 port, which again was placed under direct visualization without difficulty.  The two #5 ports were placed, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior axillary line again in similar fashion under direct visualization.  The gallbladder was then grasped out at its fundus, elevated to patient's left shoulder.  Using a curved dissector, the cystic duct was identified and freed up circumferentially.  Next, an Endoclip was used to distal and proximal to the gallbladder, Endoshears were used in between to transect the cystic duct.  The cystic artery was transected in similar fashion.  Attention was next made in removing the gallbladder from the liver bed using electrobovie cautery and spatulated tip.  It was done without difficulty.  The gallbladder was then grasped via the epigastric port and removed without difficulty and sent to pathology.  Hemostasis was maintained using electrobovie cautery.  The liver bed was then copiously irrigated and aspirated.  All the fluid and air was then aspirated and then all ports were removed under direct visualization.  The two #10 ports were then closed in the fascia with #0 Vicryl and a UR6 needle.  The skin was closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  0.25% Marcaine was injected and Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[650, 661, "ANATOMY"], [995, 1006, "ANATOMY"], [1057, 1068, "ANATOMY"], [1845, 1856, "ANATOMY"], [2266, 2277, "ANATOMY"], [2306, 2312, "ANATOMY"], [2382, 2393, "ANATOMY"], [2499, 2510, "ANATOMY"], [2560, 2571, "ANATOMY"], [2578, 2591, "ANATOMY"], [2668, 2679, "ANATOMY"], [2784, 2795, "ANATOMY"], [69, 82, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [87, 105, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [136, 149, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [154, 172, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [688, 706, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [777, 790, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [795, 813, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [530, 539, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.

The patient deteriorated with several CVAs and had became encephalopathic requiring a ventilator-dependency with respiratory failure.  The patient also had neuromuscular dysfunction.  After extended period of time, per the patient's family request and requested by the ICU staff, decision to place a feeding tube was decided and scheduled for today.\n\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: \n The patient was found to have esophagitis as well as gastritis via EGD and was placed on Prevacid granules.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  First, the EGD was to be performed.\n\nThe Olympus endoscope was inserted through the mouth, oropharynx and into the esophagus.  Esophagitis was noted.  The scope was then passed through the esophagus into the stomach.  The cardia, fundus, body, and antrum of the stomach were visualized.  There was evidence of gastritis.  The scope was passed into the duodenal bulb and sweep via the pylorus and then removed from the duodenum retroflexing on itself in the stomach looking at the hiatus.  Next, attention was made to transilluminating the anterior abdominal wall for the PEG placement.  The skin was then anesthetized with 1% lidocaine.  The finder needle was then inserted under direct visualization.  The catheter was then grasped via the endoscope and the wire was pulled back up through the patient's mouth.  The Ponsky PEG tube was attached to the wire.  A skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel.  The wire was pulled back up through the abdominal wall point and Ponsky PEG back up through the abdominal wall and inserted into position.  The endoscope was then replaced confirming position.  Photograph was taken.  The Ponsky PEG tube was trimmed and the desired attachments were placed and the patient did tolerate the procedure well.

She also had mild leukocytosis with bright blood cell count of 12,000.  The necessity for diagnostic laparoscopy was explained and possible appendectomy.  The patient is agreeable to proceed and signed preoperatively informed consent.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia by Anesthesia Department.\n\nThe preoperative Foley, antibiotics, and NG tube are placed for decompression and the anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and infraumbilical incision is performed with a #10 blade scalpel with anterior and superior traction on the abdominal wall.  A Veress needle was introduced and 15 mm pneumoperitoneum is created with CO2 insufflation.  At this point, the Veress needle was removed and a 10 mm trocar is introduced intraperitoneally.  A second 5 mm port was introduced in the right upper quadrant under direct visualization and blunted graspers were introduced to bring the appendix into view.  With the aid of a laparoscope, the pelvis was visualized.  The ovaries are brought in views and photos are taken.  There is evidence of a purulence in the cul-de-sac and ________ with a right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst.  Attention was then turned on the right lower quadrant.  The retrocecal appendix is freed with peritoneal adhesions removed with Endoshears.  Attention was turned to the suprapubic area.  The 12 mm port was introduced under direct visualization and the mesoappendix was identified.  A 45 mm endovascular stapling device was fired across the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix sequentially with no evidence of bleeding or leakage from the staple line.  Next, ________ tube was used to obtain Gram stain and cultures of the pelvic fluid and a pelvic toilet was performed with copious irrigation of sterile saline.  Next, attention was turned to the right upper quadrant.  There is evidence of adhesions from the liver surface to the anterior abdominal wall consistent with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome also a prior pelvic inflammatory disease.  All free fluid is aspirated and patient's all port sites are removed under direct visualization and the appendix is submitted to pathology for final pathology.  Once the ports are removed the pneumoperitoneum is allowed to escape for patient's postoperative comfort and two larger port sites at the suprapubic and infraumbilical sites are closed with #0 Vicryl suture on a UR-6 needle.  Local anesthetic is infiltrated at L3 port sites for postoperative analgesia and #4-0 Vicryl subcuticular closure is performed with undyed Vicryl.  Steri-Strips are applied along with sterile dressings.  The patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and transferred to recovery room with postoperative broad-spectrum IV antibiotics in the General Medical Floor.

Right hemicolectomy.\n\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE: \n The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for 26 years, previous MI and coronary artery disease, history of seizure disorder, GERD, bipolar disorder, and anemia.  She was admitted due to a seizure and myoclonic jerks as well as hypoglycemia and anemia.  Regarding the seizure disorder, Neurology was consulted.  Noncontrast CT of the head was negative.  Neurology felt that the only necessary intervention at that time would be to increase her Lamictal to 150 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening with gradual increase of the dosage until she was on 200 mg b.i.d.  Regarding the hypoglycemia, the patient has diabetic gastroparesis and was being fed on J-tube intermittent feedings throughout the night at the rate of 120 an hour.  Her insulin pump had a basal rate of roughly three at night during the feedings.  While in the hospital, the insulin pump rate was turned down to 1.5 and then subsequently decreased a few other times.  She seemed to tolerate the insulin pump rate well throughout her hospital course.  There were a few episodes of hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, but the episode seem to be related to the patient's n.p.o. status and the changing rates of tube feedings throughout her hospital course.\n\nAt discharge, her endocrinologist was contacted.  It was decided to change her insulin pump rate to 3 units per hour from midnight till 6 a.m., from 0.8 units per hour from 6 a.m. until 8 a.m., and then at 0.2 units per hour from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.  The insulin was to be NovoLog.  Regarding the anemia, the gastroenterologists were consulted regarding her positive Hemoccult stools.  A colonoscopy was performed, which found a mass at the right hepatic flexure.  General Surgery was then consulted and a right hemicolectomy was performed on the patient.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and tube feeds were slowly restarted following the procedure, and prior to discharge were back at her predischarge rates of 120 per hour.  Regarding the cancer itself, it was found that 1 out of 53 nodes were positive for cancer.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no metastasis, a CT of the chest revealed possible lung metastasis.  Later in hospital course, the patient developed a septic-like picture likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia.  She was treated with Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin, and tolerated the medications well.  Her symptoms decreased and serial chest x-rays were followed, which showed some resolution of the illness.  The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease specialist.  The Infectious Disease specialist recommended vancomycin to cover MRSA bacteria, which was found at the J-tube site.  At discharge, the patient was given three additional days of p.o. Levaquin 750 mg as well as three additional days of Bactrim DS every 12 hours.  The Bactrim was used to cover the MRSA at the J-tube site.  It was found that MRSA was sensitive to Bactrim.  Throughout her hospital course, the patient continued to receive Coreg 12.5 mg daily and Lasix 40 mg twice a day for her congestive heart failure, which remains stable.  She also received Lipitor for her high cholesterol.  Her seizure disorder remained stable and she was discharged on a dose of 100 mg in the morning and 150 mg at night.  The dosage increases can begin on an outpatient basis.\n\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS: \n The patient was discharged to home.  She was told to shy away from strenuous activity.  Her discharge diet was to be her usual diet of isotonic fiber feeding through the J-tube at a rate of 120 per hour throughout the night.  The discharge medications were as follows:\n1.  Coreg 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. at bedtime.\n3.  Nitro-Dur patch 0.3 mg per hour one patch daily.\n4.  Phenergan syrup 6.25 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.\n5.

She was given a lab sheet to have a CBC with diff as well as a CMP to be drawn prior to her appointment with Dr. X.  She is instructed to follow up with Dr. Y if her condition changes regarding her colon cancer.  She was instructed to follow up with Dr. Z, her oncologist, regarding the positive lymph nodes.  We were unable to contact Dr. Z, but his telephone number was given to the patient and she was instructed to make a followup appointment.  She was also instructed to follow up with her endocrinologist, Dr. A, regarding any insulin pump adjustments, which were necessary and she was also instructed to follow up with Dr. B, her gastroenterologist, regarding any issues with her J-tube.\n\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE: \n Stable.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[223, 228, "ANATOMY"], [616, 624, "ANATOMY"], [2626, 2632, "ANATOMY"], [5254, 5259, "ANATOMY"], [5352, 5363, "ANATOMY"], [128, 140, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [146, 152, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [274, 280, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [286, 313, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [319, 331, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [337, 361, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [550, 558, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [609, 611, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [670, 674, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [684, 692, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [698, 704, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [772, 784, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [789, 795, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1130, 1142, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1160, 1182, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1597, 1609, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1621, 1634, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2072, 2078, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2693, 2697, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2801, 2828, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3058, 3068, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3094, 3104, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3585, 3609, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3668, 3684, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [115, 122, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [175, 182, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [188, 193, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [367, 374, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [652, 659, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [733, 740, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [745, 760, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [812, 819, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2926, 2934, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3020, 3027, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3691, 3698, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        Patient complains of constipation, severe at times.

The body and antrum of the stomach were normal.  They pylorus duodenum bulb and descending duodenum are normal.  There was no blood present within the stomach.\n\nThe scope was then brought back into the stomach and retroflexed in order to inspect the upper portion of the body of the stomach.  When this was done, a prominent fold was seen lying along side the GE junction along with gastric side and there was a solitary erosion over this fold.  The lesion was not bleeding.  If this fold were in any other location of the stomach, I would consider the fold, but at this location, one would have to consider that this would be an isolated gastric varix.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  An #11 blade scalpel was used to make a small infraumbilical skin incision in the midline.  The fascia was elevated between two Ochsner clamps and then incised.  A figure-of-eight stitch of 2-0 Vicryl was placed through the fascial edges.  The 11-mm port without the trocar engaged was then placed into the abdomen.  A pneumoperitoneum was established.  After an adequate pneumoperitoneum had been established, the laparoscope was inserted.  Three additional ports were placed all under direct vision.  An 11-mm port was placed in the epigastric area.  Two 5-mm ports were placed in the right upper quadrant.  The patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and slightly rotated to the left.  The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly and laterally.  The infundibulum was retracted inferiorly and laterally.  Electrocautery was used to carefully begin dissection of the peritoneum down around the base of the gallbladder.  The triangle of Calot was carefully opened up.  The cystic duct was identified heading up into the base of the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was also identified within the triangle of Calot.  After the triangle of Calot had been carefully dissected, a clip was then placed high up on the cystic duct near its junction with the gallbladder.  The cystic artery was clipped twice proximally and once distally.  Scissors were then introduced and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct, and the cystic artery was divided.  An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained.  This revealed good flow through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct.  There was good flow into the duodenum without any filling defects.  The hepatic radicals were clearly visualized.  The cholangiocatheter was removed, and two clips were then placed distal to the ductotomy on the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was then divided using scissors.  The gallbladder was then removed up away from the liver bed using electrocautery.  The gallbladder was easily removed through the epigastric port site.  The liver bed was then irrigated and suctioned.  All dissection areas were inspected.  They were hemostatic.  There was not any bile leakage.  All clips were in place.  The right gutter up over the edge of the liver was likewise irrigated and suctioned until dry.  All ports were then removed under direct vision.  The abdominal cavity was allowed to deflate.  The fascia at the epigastric port site was closed with a stitch of 2-0 Vicryl.  The fascia at the umbilical port was closed by tying the previously placed stitch.  All skin incisions were then closed with subcuticular sutures of 4-0 Monocryl and 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine was infiltrated into all port sites.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient is currently being aroused from general endotracheal anesthesia.

He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\n The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy.\n\n\nOPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: \nA short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples.

The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.\n\n\nFINDINGS:\n\n1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.\n2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained.\n3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. NPO except ice chips today.\n2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy.\n3.

The duodenal mucosa was completely normal. The pylorus was normal. In the stomach, there was evidence of diffuse atrophic-appearing nodular gastritis. Multiple biopsies were obtained. There also was a 1.5-cm adenomatous appearing polyp along the greater curvature at the junction of the body and antrum. There was mild ulceration on the tip of this polyp. It was decided to remove the polyp via snare polypectomy. Retroflexion was performed, and this revealed a small hiatal hernia in the distal esophagus. The Z-line was identified and was unremarkable.

There is no scleral icterus. \nNECK: No jugular venous distention. \nCHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. \nCARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. \nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Bowel sounds are decreased and high-pitched. There is a large midline laparotomy scar with staples still in place. There is no evidence of wound infection. Examination of the colostomy port reveals no obvious fecal impaction or site of obstruction. There is no evidence of infection. The mucosa appears normal. There is a small amount of nonbloody stool in the colostomy bag. There are no masses or bruits noted. \nEXTREMITIES: There is no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally. \nNEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and awake with no focal motor or sensory deficit noted. \n\n\nMEDICAL DECISION MAKING:\n Failure of colostomy to function may repre- sent an impaction; however, I did not appreciate this on physical examination. There may also be an adhesion or proximal impaction which I cannot reach, which may cause a bowel obstruction, failure of the shunt, nausea, and ultimately vomiting. \n\nAn abdominal series was obtained, which confirmed this possibility by demonstrating air-fluid levels and dilated bowel. \n\nThe CBC showed WBC of 9.4 with normal differential. Hematocrit is 42.6. I interpret this as normal. Amylase is currently pending. \n\nI have discussed this case with Dr. S, the patient's surgeon, who agrees that there is a possibility of bowel obstruction and the patient should be admitted to observation. Because of the patient's insurance status, the patient will actually be admitted to Dr. D on observation. I have discussed the case with Dr. P, who is the doctor on call for Dr. D. Both Dr. S and Dr. P have been informed of the patient's condition and are aware of his situation. \n\n\nFINAL IMPRESSION:\n Bowel obstruction, status post colostomy. \n\n\nDISPOSITION:\n Admission to observation.

The differential diagnosis includes paralytic ileus and mechanical obstruction.  Paralytic ileus, which is characterized by absence of bowel sounds, gas scattered in the GI tract, dilation of the entire bowel, and a recent abdominal surgery, is unlikely in this case.  AF is more likely suffering from a bowel obstruction:  he has multiple risk factors (past abdominal surgery, multiple episodes of obstruction from adhesions) and symptoms and signs (bowel sounds, vomiting) consistent with obstruction.\n\nMechanical bowel obstruction can be caused by:\n1.  Adhesions (most cases):  typically from prior surgeries.\n2.  Hernias (second most common cause).\n3.  Tumors (15% of cases):  rare in small intestine; most common cause of large intestine obstruction.\n4.  Intussusception (especially in kids).\n5.  Volvulus (especially in elderly).\n6.  Obturation:  fecal impactions, gallstone ileus, parasitic infections.\n7.  Inflammatory lesions:  TB, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, amebiasis.\n8.  Vascular obstruction:  embolism, increased venous pressure, hypercoagulability, vascular disease; especially in elderly.\n\nGiven the patient's history of multiple abdominal surgeries and adhesions causing small bowel obstruction, AF's obstruction is most likely caused by adhesions.\n\nOne question to answer in any patient presenting with bowel obstruction is whether the obstruction is in the small or large intestine.  In small bowel obstruction, the pain is sharp and frequent, with early vomiting and electrolyte imbalance.  In contrast, large bowel obstruction may present in elderly patients without vomiting, and typically without hernias or a history of abdominal surgery.  Radiographic studies can definitively locate the site of the obstruction.  In this patient, though the radiographic evidence was equivocal, the presence of vomiting and the quality and frequency of his pain suggested small bowel obstruction.\n\n\nPLAN: \n There has been a great deal of debate about the best way to treat patients with mechanical obstruction.  I will focus on the question of whether a patient should be managed conservatively or with an operation.  This question is vital because mechanical obstruction may lead to strangulation and perforation, life-threatening consequences.  There is no reliable way to determine whether the patient is already suffering from strangulated bowel, and next to impossible to predict which patients will suffer from strangulation.\n\nPatients that have hernias are sent immediately to the operating room for a repair; the surgeon will resect any nonviable bowel.  For patients suffering from an obstruction due to adhesions, the decision becomes difficult.  Fifteen percent of these patients may have strangulating obstruction.  Simple (nonstrangulating) bowel obstruction typically presents with intermittent, colicky pain.  Strangulating obstruction, in contrast, usually presents with steady unrelenting pain.  Other signs include a palpable mass, increased temperature and heart rate, and lab studies indicating acute inflammation.\n\nSeveral studies have examined the ability of these signs to predict when strangulation is present.  After a study of 238 patients with small bowel obstruction, Stewardson et al. (1978) suggest that physicians, instead of considering individual signs, look at a combination of &amp;quot;classic findings&amp;quot; including leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia, and localized tenderness.  They recommend conservative treatment only for patients with none or only one of these signs.  Ninety percent of patients with strangulated bowel had two or more signs.  Bizer et al. (1981), on the other hand, found no correlation between these signs and the presence of strangulation.  They did find a correlation with age, feculent vomiting, peristaltitic sounds, and a white cell count above 18,000.\n\nIt is clear that there are no absolute guidelines determining whether a patient can be treated conservatively or must get an operation.  Improvements in imaging techniques in the recent past have aided in these critical decisions.  Computed tomography can frequently be used to diagnose strangulation, however in the majority of cases misses the diagnosis.  Apparently, the decision to operate ultimately falls on the judgment of the surgeon who must take into account all of the findings in combination.\n\nThe operative treatment of mechanical obstruction is removing the obstruction resecting nonviable bowel, and creating a bypass if necessary.  Conservative treatment primarily includes decompression, rehydration, and frequent monitoring.  The physician must also decide on what type of tube should be used to decompress, and how long the nonoperative treatment will be attempted before resorting to surgery.  The question of the tube has been a controversy for years, some advocating the nasogastric tube for all patients, others advocating a nasointestinal tube for distal obstructions.  Maglinte et al. (2001) explain that nasointestinal tubes are more effective at decompressing distal obstructions, and suggest that physicians use a multipurpose tube that can be used as a nasogatric tube, a nasointestinal tube, and a diagnostic tool (can provide route for enteroclysis).  Nasogastric tubes are especially unable to decompress distal distention in patients with a competent pyloric sphincter.\n\nFinally, the length of the trial period of nonoperative management is also debatable.  Seror et al. (1993) suggest a 5-day trial to allow time for spontaneous resolution, and report a 73% success rate in a study of patients with a history of bowel surgery.  In contrast, Deutsch et al. (1989) suggest only a 24 hour trial of conservative therapy, and only for patients with partial obstruction.  Again, it appears as though this decision presently is at the discretion of the surgeon caring for the patient.\n\nIn the case of patient AF, his findings made the decision to operate particularly difficult.  He was clearly tachycardic; his WBC was elevated, but not above 18,000.  His abdominal pain was steady and unrelenting, and could be localized to the LLQ, but he was afebrile.  His abdominal CT was consistent with small bowel obstruction, but not definitive.  In the end, based on the team's desire to avoid another abdominal surgery that could lead to more adhesions and another obstruction, we chose conservative management, with nasogastric tube decompression, rehydration, and close observation.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[324, 329, "ANATOMY"], [592, 603, "ANATOMY"], [2028, 2041, "ANATOMY"], [2112, 2127, "ANATOMY"], [2135, 2140, "ANATOMY"], [2270, 2275, "ANATOMY"], [2380, 2385, "ANATOMY"], [2580, 2585, "ANATOMY"], [2696, 2707, "ANATOMY"], [2718, 2726, "ANATOMY"], [2751, 2761, "ANATOMY"], [2806, 2826, "ANATOMY"], [2894, 2898, "ANATOMY"], [2914, 2921, "ANATOMY"], [2982, 3004, "ANATOMY"], [3030, 3041, "ANATOMY"], [3088, 3099, "ANATOMY"], [3413, 3418, "ANATOMY"], [3481, 3486, "ANATOMY"], [3582, 3587, "ANATOMY"], [3729, 3734, "ANATOMY"], [3794, 3799, "ANATOMY"], [3967, 3982, "ANATOMY"], [4005, 4020, "ANATOMY"], [4274, 4282, "ANATOMY"], [4354, 4362, "ANATOMY"], [4478, 4489, "ANATOMY"], [4611, 4616, "ANATOMY"], [4675, 4690, "ANATOMY"], [4696, 4707, "ANATOMY"], [4814, 4825, "ANATOMY"], [5171, 5182, "ANATOMY"], [5643, 5648, "ANATOMY"], [5854, 5859, "ANATOMY"], [6053, 6058, "ANATOMY"], [6275, 6280, "ANATOMY"], [6470, 6481, "ANATOMY"], [6859, 6864, "ANATOMY"], [6923, 6927, "ANATOMY"], [7727, 7732, "ANATOMY"], [8607, 8614, "ANATOMY"], [8869, 8874, "ANATOMY"], [9444, 9455, "ANATOMY"], [70, 72, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [90, 99, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [255, 257, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [395, 397, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [455, 457, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [702, 721, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [723, 732, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [745, 763, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [787, 799, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [801, 806, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [837, 844, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [870, 885, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [887, 893, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [924, 939, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [941, 950, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1021, 1023, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1260, 1279, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1294, 1305, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1388, 1390, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1568, 1570, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1813, 1819, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [2451, 2454, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3173, 3175, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3250, 3261, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3314, 3329, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3359, 3374, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4038, 4053, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4080, 4088, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4149, 4164, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4166, 4186, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4215, 4217, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4219, 4237, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4239, 4249, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4259, 4268, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4334, 4352, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [6658, 6670, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [167, 181, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [202, 208, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [213, 221, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [244, 251, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [260, 268, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [377, 384, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [412, 416, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [620, 634, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [846, 858, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [860, 868, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [972, 982, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1759, 1767, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2167, 2183, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2242, 2245, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2480, 2498, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3219, 3233, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3267, 3275, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3709, 3717, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3743, 3751, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4725, 4729, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4764, 4772, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4878, 4886, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [5110, 5118, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [5156, 5160, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [6109, 6121, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [6672, 6677, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [6706, 6716, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [7044, 7061, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [9307, 9321, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPRESENTATION: \n A 16-year-old male presents to the emergency department (ED) with rectal bleeding and pain on defecation.\n\n\nHISTORY:\n  A 16-year-old African American male presents to the ED with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and pain on defecation.  The patient states that he was well until about three days prior to presentation when he first started to experience some pain when defecating.  The following day he noted increasing pain and first noted blood on the surface of his stool.  The pain worsened on the subsequent day with increasing bleeding as well as some mucopurulent anal discharge.  The patient denies any previous history of rectal bleeding or pain.  He also denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and states that he was screened for HIV infection eight months ago and was negative.  The patient does state that he has not felt well for the past week.  He states that he had felt &amp;quot;feverish&amp;quot; on several occasions but has not taken his temperature.  He has also complained of some abdominal discomfort with nausea and diarrhea as well as generalized myalgias and fatigue.  He thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not been weighing himself to determine the exact amount of weight loss.\n\nThe patient states that he has been sexually active since age 13.  He admits to eight previous partners and states that he &amp;quot;usually&amp;quot; uses a condom.  On further questioning, the patient states that of his eight partners, three were female and five were male.  His most recent sexual partner was a 38-year-old man whom he has been with for the past six months.  He states that he has been tested for STDs in the past but states that he only gave urine and blood for the testing.  He is unaware of the HIV status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he looks healthy.  The patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family.  As the man was a member of the family's church, the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adults in his life.  He is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family, as they have expressed very negative comments concerning men who have sex with men.  He is accessing care in the ED unaccompanied by an adult.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: \n Thin but non-toxic young man with clear discomfort.\nPulse = 105\nRR = 23\nBP = 120/62\nHEENT:  Several areas of white plaque-like material on the buccal mucosa.\nNeck:  Multiple anterior/posterior cervical nodes in both anterior and posterior chains- 1-2 cm in diameter.\nLungs:  Clear to auscultation.\nCardiac:  Quiet precordium.\nNl S1/S2 with a II/VI systolic murmur. \nAbdomen:  Soft without hepatosplenomegaly.\nGU:  Tanner V male with no external penile lesions.\nLymph:  2-3 cm axillary nodes bilaterally.\n1-2 cm epitrochlear nodes.\nMultiple 1-2 cm inguinal nodes.\nRectal:  Extremely painful digital exam.\n+ gross blood and mucous.\n\n\nLABORATORY EVALUATION:\n\nHbg = 12.  5 gm/dL\nHct = 32%\nWBC = 3.9 thou/&amp;micro;L\nPlatelets = 120,000 thou/&amp;micro;L\n76% neutrophils\n19% lymphocytes\n1% eosinophils\n4% monocytes\nALT = 82 U/L\nAST= 90 U/L\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate = 90\nElectrolytes = normal\nGram stain of anal swab:  numerous WBCs\n\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: \n This patient is presenting with acute rectal pain with bleeding and anal discharge.  The patient also presents with some constitutional symptoms including fever, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and adenopathy on physical examination.  The following are in the differential diagnosis:  Acute Proctitis and  Proctocolitis.\n\n\nACUTE HIV SEROCONVERSION: \n This subject is sexually active and reports inconsistent condom use.  Gastrointestinal symptoms have recently been reported commonly in patients with a history of HIV seroconversion.  The rectal symptoms of bleeding and pain are not common with HIV, and an alternative diagnosis would be required.\n\n\nPERIRECTAL ABSCESS: \n A patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent STD.  The patient could experience more systemic symptoms with fever and malaise, as found with this patient.  However, the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edema.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:  \nThe subject had rectal cultures obtained, which were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  An HIV ELISA was positive, as was the RNA PCR.\n\n\nDISCUSSION: \n This patient demonstrates a number of key issues to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult.  First, the patient utilized the emergency department for care as opposed to identifying a primary care provider.  Although not ideal in many circumstances, testing for HIV infection is crucial when there is suspicion, since many newly diagnosed patients identify earlier contacts with health care providers when HIV counseling and testing were not performed.  Second, this young man has had both male and female sexual partners.  As young people explore their sexuality, asking about partners in an open, nonjudgmental manner without applying labels is integral to helping the young person discuss their sexual behaviors.  Assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have same-sex attractions.  Third, screening for STDs must take into account sexual behaviors.  Although urine-based screening has expanded testing of young people, it misses anal and pharyngeal infections.  If a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out STDs.  Fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms.  As his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current STD, performing an HIV test should be part of the standard evaluation.  In addition, as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, PCR testing should also be considered.  The care provided to this young man included the following.  He was treated presumptively for proctitis with both IM ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis.  Ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant N gonorrhoeae.  At the time of the diagnosis, the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent-specific HIV program.  The case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support.  The case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later.  Over the subsequent three months, the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his HIV infection.\n\nSet #1 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 225 cells/mm3, 15% \nQuantitative RNA PCR = 75,000 copies/mL\n\nSet #2 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 385 cells/mm3, 21%\nQuantitative RNA PCR = 12,000 copies/mL\n\nThe risks and benefits of ART were discussed over three clinical visits.  This patient agreed with not starting ART and following his CD4 and viral loads every three months.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[634, 638, "ANATOMY"], [2519, 2532, "ANATOMY"], [2643, 2648, "ANATOMY"], [2674, 2681, "ANATOMY"], [2821, 2827, "ANATOMY"], [2852, 2866, "ANATOMY"], [3284, 3288, "ANATOMY"], [3406, 3410, "ANATOMY"], [4048, 4052, "ANATOMY"], [5511, 5515, "ANATOMY"], [5520, 5530, "ANATOMY"], [5595, 5599, "ANATOMY"], [5737, 5741, "ANATOMY"], [748, 777, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [821, 834, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [1708, 1712, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3535, 3545, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3622, 3637, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3643, 3656, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [3999, 4006, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4104, 4111, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [4797, 4810, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [5385, 5389, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [5657, 5661, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [5873, 5888, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [6057, 6066, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [6687, 6700, "DISEASESYNDROME"], [145, 149, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [279, 283, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [422, 426, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [483, 487, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [544, 548, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [713, 717, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [977, 985, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1084, 1104, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1110, 1116, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1121, 1129, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1153, 1161, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [1166, 1173, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2416, 2426, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2765, 2783, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [2958, 2965, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3376, 3387, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3459, 3482, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3493, 3498, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3500, 3507, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3509, 3529, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3758, 3783, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3876, 3891, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [3908, 3912, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4196, 4204, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4210, 4215, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4220, 4227, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4337, 4341, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [4346, 4351, "SIGNSYMPTOM"], [5719, 5727, "SIGNSYMPTOM"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROCEDURE: \n Colonoscopy.\n\n\nINDICATIONS: \n Hematochezia, Personal history of colonic polyps.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n  Midazolam 2 mg IV, Fentanyl 100 mcg IV\n\n\nPROCEDURE:\n  A History and Physical has been performed, and patient medication allergies have been reviewed.
