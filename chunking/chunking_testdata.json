A Foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed.  The chest, abdomen, both groin, and perineum were prepped widely with Betadine and draped as a sterile field with an Ioban drape.  A long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered.  A sterile Omni-Tract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed.  With the exception of the vascular findings to be described, there were no apparent intra-abdominal abnormalities.\n\nThe transverse colon retracted superiorly.  The small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant.  The posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of Treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein.  Dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries.  The mid left renal artery was likewise identified.  The perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery.  During this portion of the dissection, the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis.  The distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery.  The arteries were suitable for control.\n\nThe patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time.  The aneurysm was repaired.\n\nFirst, the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps.  The inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery.  The aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed.  There was a high-grade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site.  The vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp.  Two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 2-0 silk.  A 14 mm Hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn end-to-end fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  At the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 3-0 Prolene were required for hemostasis.  The graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn end-to-end at the iliac bifurcation using semi-continuous 3-0 Prolene suture.  Prior to completion of this anastomosis, the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation.  The distal anastomosis was competent without leak.\n\nThe patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation.  The back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous.  The colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 2-0 silk.  The aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 3-0 PDS in a vest-over-pants fashion.  The posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 3-0 PDS.  The entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the SMA normal appearance of the entire viscera.  The NG tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location.  The midline fascia was then reapproximated using running #1 PDS suture.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution.  The skin edges coapted using surgical staples.\n\nAt the conclusion of the case, sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[128, 133, "ANATOMY"], [575, 590, "ANATOMY"], [700, 722, "ANATOMY"], [753, 758, "ANATOMY"], [760, 767, "ANATOMY"], [774, 779, "ANATOMY"], [785, 793, "ANATOMY"], [920, 925, "ANATOMY"], [961, 968, "ANATOMY"], [1008, 1013, "ANATOMY"], [1059, 1073, "ANATOMY"], [1104, 1111, "ANATOMY"], [1154, 1162, "ANATOMY"], [1218, 1227, "ANATOMY"], [1228, 1241, "ANATOMY"], [1248, 1264, "ANATOMY"], [1292, 1303, "ANATOMY"], [1395, 1405, "ANATOMY"], [1456, 1474, "ANATOMY"], [1512, 1536, "ANATOMY"], [1587, 1602, "ANATOMY"], [1635, 1649, "ANATOMY"], [1660, 1677, "ANATOMY"], [1718, 1723, "ANATOMY"], [1772, 1789, "ANATOMY"], [1988, 2007, "ANATOMY"], [2014, 2022, "ANATOMY"], [2225, 2248, "ANATOMY"], [2303, 2320, "ANATOMY"], [2378, 2384, "ANATOMY"], [2415, 2420, "ANATOMY"], [2438, 2450, "ANATOMY"], [2625, 2651, "ANATOMY"], [2716, 2722, "ANATOMY"], [2780, 2795, "ANATOMY"], [2850, 2855, "ANATOMY"], [2913, 2918, "ANATOMY"], [2955, 2961, "ANATOMY"], [2985, 2996, "ANATOMY"], [3068, 3073, "ANATOMY"], [3131, 3136, "ANATOMY"], [3183, 3189, "ANATOMY"], [3220, 3231, "ANATOMY"], [3237, 3242, "ANATOMY"], [3277, 3282, "ANATOMY"], [3359, 3365, "ANATOMY"], [3399, 3414, "ANATOMY"], [3656, 3682, "ANATOMY"], [3733, 3738, "ANATOMY"], [3773, 3779, "ANATOMY"], [3853, 3859, "ANATOMY"], [3927, 3937, "ANATOMY"], [4002, 4013, "ANATOMY"], [4136, 4143, "ANATOMY"], [4180, 4201, "ANATOMY"], [4210, 4217, "ANATOMY"], [4236, 4253, "ANATOMY"], [4268, 4274, "ANATOMY"], [4320, 4326, "ANATOMY"], [4333, 4353, "ANATOMY"], [4414, 4418, "ANATOMY"], [75, 100, "DISEASE"], [178, 203, "DISEASE"], [249, 274, "DISEASE"], [844, 851, "DISEASE"], [995, 1002, "DISEASE"], [1385, 1394, "DISEASE"], [1406, 1415, "DISEASE"], [1420, 1428, "DISEASE"], [2190, 2198, "DISEASE"], [2457, 2465, "DISEASE"], [2490, 2498, "DISEASE"], [2543, 2551, "DISEASE"], [2595, 2603, "DISEASE"], [3078, 3081, "DISEASE"], [3247, 3254, "DISEASE"], [3638, 3646, "DISEASE"], [3814, 3822, "DISEASE"], [3878, 3881, "DISEASE"], [3917, 3926, "DISEASE"], [3975, 3978, "DISEASE"], [4100, 4103, "DISEASE"], [4316, 4319, "DISEASE"], [4533, 4540, "DISEASE"], [819, 827, "DRUG"], [1078, 1084, "DRUG"], [1889, 1897, "DRUG"], [2041, 2048, "DRUG"], [2104, 2118, "DRUG"], [2403, 2410, "DRUG"], [2819, 2823, "DRUG"], [3562, 3571, "DRUG"], [3803, 3807, "DRUG"], [4374, 4384, "DRUG"], [4389, 4398, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nINDICATIONS: \n This is a 55-year-old female who is having a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer.

Colonoscopy is indicated to evaluate for etiology.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was brought to the endoscopy suite with IV fluids being administered.  She was given a total of 300 mcg of fentanyl and 15 mg of Versed, titrated for conscious IV sedation.  Her heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the procedure.  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  The procedure began with a digital rectal examination.  The scope was then placed through the anus and advanced without difficulty to the terminal ileum.  There was what appeared to be some inflammation of the terminal ileum.  This was biopsied.  The scope was then withdrawn into the cecum, where biopsies were obtained.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn throughout the entire length of the colon.  The prep was adequate, but multiple syringes of irrigation were necessary to irrigate out some of the residual stool and allow for better visualization of the colonic mucosa.  There was an area of induration and inflammation at the hepatic flexure.  This was biopsied.  The scope was again withdrawn throughout the length of the colon.  There was also some area of inflammation in the sigmoid colon with narrowing.  Again, these findings were seen on the way in with the colonoscope and were not due to scope trauma or the procedure itself.  Further biopsies were obtained of the sigmoid colon in this area of narrowing.  Total biopsies included terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon.  The scope was then withdrawn into the rectum.  Retroflexion showed a normal-appearing anal canal with no internal hemorrhoids or fissures.  Other than the areas of inflammation, there were no other abnormalities identified, no AV malformations, no polyps, no diverticulum.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

The oral cavity is sprayed with lidocaine spray.  A bite block is placed.  Versed IV 5 mg and 100 mcg of IV fentanyl was given in cautious increments.  The GIF-160 diagnostic gastroscope used.  The patient was alert during the procedure.  The esophagus was intubated under direct visualization.  The scope was advanced toward the GE junction with active reflux esophagitis involving the distal one-third of the esophagus noted.  The stomach was unremarkable.  Retroflexed exam unremarkable.  Duodenum not intubated in order to minimize the time spent during the procedure.  The patient was alert although not combative.  A balloon was then inserted across the GE junction, 15 mm to 18 mm, and inflated to 3, 4.7, and 7 ATM, and left inflated at 18 mm for 45 seconds.  The balloon was then deflated.  The patient became uncomfortable and a good-size adequate distal esophageal tear was noted.  The scope and balloon were then withdrawn.  The patient left in good condition.\n\n\nIMPRESSION: \n Successful dilation of distal esophageal fracture in the setting of active reflux esophagitis albeit mild.\n\n\nPLAN: \n I will recommend that the patient be on lifelong proton pump inhibition and have repeat endoscopy performed as needed.  This has been discussed with the parents.  He was sent home with a prescription for omeprazole.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[285, 296, "ANATOMY"], [524, 533, "ANATOMY"], [611, 613, "ANATOMY"], [692, 701, "ANATOMY"], [714, 721, "ANATOMY"], [773, 781, "ANATOMY"], [941, 943, "ANATOMY"], [95, 104, "DISEASE"], [162, 180, "DISEASE"], [300, 307, "DISEASE"], [333, 337, "DISEASE"], [338, 343, "DISEASE"], [635, 653, "DISEASE"], [890, 899, "DISEASE"], [1000, 1003, "DISEASE"], [1146, 1161, "DISEASE"], [1243, 1252, "DISEASE"], [1281, 1289, "DISEASE"], [1311, 1319, "DISEASE"], [1345, 1363, "DISEASE"], [1379, 1383, "DISEASE"], [313, 322, "DRUG"], [356, 362, "DRUG"], [389, 397, "DRUG"], [1591, 1601, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine position.

The patient states that he had his first colonoscopy 6 years ago and it was negative.  His mother was diagnosed with colon cancer probably in her 50s, but she died of cancer of the esophagus at age 86.  The patient does have hemorrhoidal bleed about once a week.  Otherwise, he denies any change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or weight loss.  He gets heartburn mainly with certain food such as raw onions and he has had it for years.  It will typically occur every couple of weeks.  He has had no dysphagia.  He has never had an upper endoscopy.\n\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY: \n Remarkable for hypertension, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and restless legs syndrome.\n\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY: \n Appendectomy as a child and cholecystectomy in 2003.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  \nHis medications are lisinopril 40 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg twice a day, Januvia 100 mg daily, clonazepam 10 mg at bedtime for restless legs syndrome, Crestor 10 mg nightly, and Flomax 0.4 mg daily.\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n No known drug allergies.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \n The patient is retired.  He is married.  He had 4 children.  He quite smoking 25 years ago after a 35-year history of smoking.  He does not drink alcohol.\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: \n Mother had colon cancer in her 50s, esophageal cancer in her 80s.  Her mother smoked and drank.  Father got a mesothelioma at age 65.  There is a brother of 65 with hypertension.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: \n He has had prostatitis with benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He has some increased urinary frequency from a history of prostatitis.  He has the heartburn, which is diet dependent and the frequent rectal bleeding.  He also has restless legs syndrome at night.  No cardio or pulmonary complaints.  No weight loss.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: \n Reveals a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress.  BP 112/70.  Pulse 80 and regular.  Respirations non-labored.  Height 5 feet 7-1/2 inches.  Weight 209 pounds.  HEENT exam:  Sclerae are anicteric.  Pupils equal, conjunctivae clear.  No gross oropharyngeal lesions.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or JVD.  Lungs are clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart sounds are regular without murmur, gallop, or rub.  The abdomen is soft and nontender.  There are no masses.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  The bowel sounds are normal.  Rectal examination:  Deferred.  Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Skin is warm and dry.  The patient is alert and oriented with a pleasant affect and no gross motor deficits.\n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.  Family history of colon cancer.\n2.  Rectal bleeding.\n3.  Heartburn and a family history of esophageal cancer.\n\n\nPLAN:\n  I agree with the indications for repeat colonoscopy, which should be done at least every 5 years.  Also, discussed IRC to treat bleeding and internal hemorrhoids if he is deemed to be an appropriate candidate at the time of his colonoscopy and the patient was agreeable.  I am also a little concerned about his family history of esophageal cancer and his personal history of heartburn and suggested that we check him once for Barrett's esophagus.  If he does not have it now then it should not be a significant risk in the future.  The indications and benefits of EGD, colonoscopy, and IRC were discussed.  The risks including sedation, bleeding, infection, and perforation were discussed.  The importance of a good bowel prep so as to minimize missing any lesions was discussed.  His questions were answered and informed consent obtained.

She comes for discussion of a screening colonoscopy.  Her last colonoscopy was in 2002, and at that time she was told it was essentially normal.  Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy.  I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so.  She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain.  She has had no hematochezia.  She denies any melena.  She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n  On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history.  Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says.  She does not know exactly what was done.  It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists.  This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done.  She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital.  Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses.  She does suffer from some mild gastroparesis, she says.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS: \n Reglan 10 mg once a day.\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n She denies any allergies to medications but is sensitive to medications that cause her to have ulcers, she says.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \n She still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day.  She was counseled to quit.  She occasionally uses alcohol.  She has never used illicit drugs.  She is married, is a housewife, and has four children.\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: \n Positive for diabetes and cancer.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: \n Essentially as mentioned above.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n\nGENERAL:  A is a healthy appearing female in no apparent distress.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Her vital signs reveal a weight of 164 pounds, blood pressure 140/90, temperature of 97.6 degrees F.\nHEENT:  No cervical bruits, thyromegaly, or masses.  She has no lymphadenopathy in the head and neck, supraclavicular, or axillary spaces bilaterally.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rubs, or rhonchi.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.\nEXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, with good pulses in the radial arteries bilaterally.\nNEURO:  No focal deficits, is intact to soft touch in all four.\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: \n In light of her history and physical, clearly the patient would be well served with an upper and lower endoscopy.  We do not know what the anatomy is, and if she did have an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers.  She also complains of significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years as well.  I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to upper and lower endoscopy, and these include over sedation, perforation, and dehydration, and she wants to proceed.\n\nWe will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at her convenience.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[675, 680, "ANATOMY"], [1093, 1104, "ANATOMY"], [1109, 1117, "ANATOMY"], [1998, 2003, "ANATOMY"], [2009, 2017, "ANATOMY"], [2085, 2098, "ANATOMY"], [2120, 2128, "ANATOMY"], [2149, 2154, "ANATOMY"], [2226, 2231, "ANATOMY"], [2290, 2297, "ANATOMY"], [2331, 2342, "ANATOMY"], [2402, 2417, "ANATOMY"], [2670, 2677, "ANATOMY"], [623, 629, "DISEASE"], [857, 862, "DISEASE"], [863, 870, "DISEASE"], [1226, 1235, "DISEASE"], [1247, 1253, "DISEASE"], [1269, 1282, "DISEASE"], [1338, 1347, "DISEASE"], [1366, 1375, "DISEASE"], [1446, 1452, "DISEASE"], [1715, 1723, "DISEASE"], [1728, 1734, "DISEASE"], [2026, 2037, "DISEASE"], [2199, 2206, "DISEASE"], [2348, 2356, "DISEASE"], [2358, 2366, "DISEASE"], [2371, 2376, "DISEASE"], [2745, 2760, "DISEASE"], [2797, 2803, "DISEASE"], [3005, 3016, "DISEASE"], [756, 761, "DRUG"], [1296, 1307, "DRUG"], [1311, 1317, "DRUG"], [1379, 1390, "DRUG"], [1411, 1422, "DRUG"], [1582, 1589, "DRUG"], [1611, 1624, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nCHIEF COMPLAINT: \n &amp;quot;I want my colostomy reversed.&amp;quot;\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: \n Mr. A is a pleasant 43-year-old African-American male who presents to our clinic for a colostomy reversal as well as repair of an incisional hernia.  The patient states that in November 2007, he presented to High Point Regional Hospital with sharp left lower quadrant pain and was emergently taken to Surgery where he woke up with a &amp;quot;bag.&amp;quot;  According to some notes that were faxed to our office from the surgeon in High Point who performed his initial surgery, Dr. X, the patient had diverticulitis with perforated sigmoid colon, and underwent a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch.  The patient was unaware of his diagnosis; therefore, we discussed that with him today in clinic.  The patient also complains of the development of an incisional hernia since his surgery in November.  He was seen back by Dr. X in April 2008 and hopes that Dr. X may reverse his colostomy and repair his hernia since he did his initial surgery, but because the patient has lost his job and has no insurance, he was referred to our clinic by Dr. X.  Currently, the patient does state that his hernia bothers him more so than his colostomy, and if it were not for the hernia then he may just refrain from having his colostomy reversed; however, the hernia has grown in size and causing him significant discomfort.  He feels that he always has to hold his hand over the hernia to prevent it from prolapsing and causing him even more discomfort.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:\n\n1.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n2.  Question of hypertension.\n3.  Status post sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November 2007 at High Point Regional.\n4.  Status post cholecystectomy.\n7.  Status post unknown foot surgery.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n  None.\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n No known drug allergies.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \n The patient lives in Greensboro.  He smokes one pack of cigarettes a day and has done so for 15 years.  He denies any IV drug use and has an occasional alcohol.\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  \nPositive for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: \n Please see history of present illness; otherwise, the review of systems is negative.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 95.9, pulse 67, blood pressure 135/79, and weight 208 pounds.\nGENERAL:  This is a pleasant African-American male appearing his stated age in no acute distress.\nHEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Moist mucous membranes.  Extraocular movements intact.\nNECK:  Supple, no JVD, and no lymphadenopathy.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended with a left lower quadrant stoma.  The stoma is pink, protuberant, and productive.  The patient also has a midline incisional hernia approximately 6 cm in diameter.  It is reducible.  Otherwise, there are no further hernias or masses noted.\nEXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \nThis is a 43-year-old gentleman who underwent what sounds like a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch in November of 2007 secondary to perforated colon from diverticulitis.  The patient presents for reversal of his colostomy as well as repair of his incisional hernia.  I have asked the patient to return to High Point Regional and get his medical records including the operative note and pathology results from his initial surgery so that I would have a better idea of what was done during his initial surgery.  He stated that he would try and do this and bring the records to our clinic on his next appointment.  I have also set him up for a barium enema to study the rectal stump.  He will return to us in two weeks at which time we will review his radiological studies and his medical records from the outside hospital and determine the best course of action from that point.  This was discussed with the patient as well as his sister and significant other in the clinic today.  They were in agreement with this plan.  We also called the social worker to come and help the patient get more ostomy appliances, as he stated that he had no more and he was having to reuse the existing ostomy bag.  To my understanding, his social worker, as well as the ostomy nurses were able to get him some assistance with this.\n\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[677, 690, "ANATOMY"], [749, 765, "ANATOMY"], [1070, 1076, "ANATOMY"], [1258, 1264, "ANATOMY"], [1332, 1338, "ANATOMY"], [1413, 1419, "ANATOMY"], [1519, 1523, "ANATOMY"], [1533, 1539, "ANATOMY"], [1770, 1786, "ANATOMY"], [2548, 2553, "ANATOMY"], [2584, 2590, "ANATOMY"], [2657, 2673, "ANATOMY"], [2706, 2710, "ANATOMY"], [2753, 2767, "ANATOMY"], [2795, 2800, "ANATOMY"], [2838, 2845, "ANATOMY"], [2909, 2914, "ANATOMY"], [2921, 2926, "ANATOMY"], [3098, 3105, "ANATOMY"], [3123, 3134, "ANATOMY"], [3300, 3316, "ANATOMY"], [3885, 3891, "ANATOMY"], [3892, 3897, "ANATOMY"], [274, 291, "DISEASE"], [392, 416, "DISEASE"], [646, 660, "DISEASE"], [918, 935, "DISEASE"], [1466, 1476, "DISEASE"], [1596, 1606, "DISEASE"], [1650, 1681, "DISEASE"], [1699, 1711, "DISEASE"], [1924, 1933, "DISEASE"], [2176, 2184, "DISEASE"], [2186, 2198, "DISEASE"], [2204, 2227, "DISEASE"], [2997, 3014, "DISEASE"], [3140, 3148, "DISEASE"], [3150, 3158, "DISEASE"], [3162, 3167, "DISEASE"], [3186, 3190, "DISEASE"], [3350, 3366, "DISEASE"], [3372, 3386, "DISEASE"], [3465, 3482, "DISEASE"], [3604, 3613, "DISEASE"], [848, 853, "DRUG"], [1543, 1550, "DRUG"], [1901, 1912, "DRUG"], [2134, 2141, "DRUG"], [4190, 4195, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROCEDURE: \n Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy.\n\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n A 1-year-10-month-old with a history of dysphagia to solids.

The opportunity for questions was provided, and informed consent was obtained.  Once the consent was obtained, the patient was sedated with IV medications and intubated by Dr. Fernandez and placed in the supine position.  Then, the tip of the XP-160 videoscope was introduced into the oropharynx, and under direct visualization, we could advance the endoscope into the upper, mid, and lower esophagus.  We did not find any strictures in the upper esophagus, but the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter totally loose.  Then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the stomach and guided into the pylorus, and then into the first portion of the duodenum.  We noticed that the patient had several ulcers in the first portion of the duodenum.  Then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the second portion of the duodenum, one biopsy was taken there, and then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the first portion, and two biopsies were taken there.  Then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the antrum, where two biopsies were taken, and one biopsy for CLOtest.  By retroflexed view, at the level of the body of the stomach, I could see that the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter loose.  Finally, the endoscope was unflexed and was brought back to the lower esophagus, where two biopsies were taken.  At the end, air was suctioned from the stomach, and the endoscope was removed out of the patient's mouth.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications.\n\n\nFINAL IMPRESSION:  \n1.  Duodenal ulcers.\n2.  Loose lower esophageal sphincter.\n\n\nPLAN:\n\n1.  To start omeprazole 20 mg a day.\n2.  To review the biopsies.\n3.

Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.  It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall.  CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.  Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:  \nGeneral anesthesia.\n\n\nINSTRUMENT:\n  Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.\n\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: \n None.\n\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:\n  Less than 5 mL.\n\n\nFINDINGS: \n With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia.  The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach.  The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.\n\nThe patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy.  Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge.  The colonic clean out was excellent.  The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum.  The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm.  No fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.\n\n\nIMPRESSION: \n Normal esophagus and duodenum.  There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve.  All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease.\n\n\nPLAN:  \nBegin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily.  Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results.  If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion.  We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy.  Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate.  We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula.  He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy.  If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[316, 323, "ANATOMY"], [333, 356, "ANATOMY"], [400, 422, "ANATOMY"], [482, 489, "ANATOMY"], [498, 512, "ANATOMY"], [539, 553, "ANATOMY"], [965, 976, "ANATOMY"], [1011, 1020, "ANATOMY"], [1039, 1046, "ANATOMY"], [1062, 1070, "ANATOMY"], [1081, 1107, "ANATOMY"], [1146, 1154, "ANATOMY"], [1248, 1255, "ANATOMY"], [1367, 1375, "ANATOMY"], [1401, 1407, "ANATOMY"], [1409, 1413, "ANATOMY"], [1478, 1485, "ANATOMY"], [1540, 1547, "ANATOMY"], [1548, 1553, "ANATOMY"], [1582, 1611, "ANATOMY"], [1630, 1637, "ANATOMY"], [1701, 1731, "ANATOMY"], [1733, 1739, "ANATOMY"], [1741, 1745, "ANATOMY"], [1758, 1767, "ANATOMY"], [1794, 1802, "ANATOMY"], [1864, 1870, "ANATOMY"], [1923, 1930, "ANATOMY"], [2135, 2151, "ANATOMY"], [2210, 2220, "ANATOMY"], [2227, 2234, "ANATOMY"], [2310, 2315, "ANATOMY"], [2322, 2327, "ANATOMY"], [2372, 2387, "ANATOMY"], [2446, 2451, "ANATOMY"], [2537, 2544, "ANATOMY"], [2550, 2556, "ANATOMY"], [2563, 2577, "ANATOMY"], [2675, 2691, "ANATOMY"], [2724, 2729, "ANATOMY"], [2740, 2756, "ANATOMY"], [2764, 2776, "ANATOMY"], [2788, 2794, "ANATOMY"], [2808, 2816, "ANATOMY"], [2835, 2840, "ANATOMY"], [2877, 2882, "ANATOMY"], [3040, 3048, "ANATOMY"], [3083, 3091, "ANATOMY"], [3118, 3125, "ANATOMY"], [3181, 3186, "ANATOMY"], [3199, 3204, "ANATOMY"], [3256, 3271, "ANATOMY"], [3382, 3385, "ANATOMY"], [3923, 3946, "ANATOMY"], [3986, 4002, "ANATOMY"], [4037, 4052, "ANATOMY"], [4146, 4157, "ANATOMY"], [4201, 4208, "ANATOMY"], [4280, 4295, "ANATOMY"], [207, 221, "DISEASE"], [594, 609, "DISEASE"], [652, 667, "DISEASE"], [753, 766, "DISEASE"], [1451, 1458, "DISEASE"], [2337, 2352, "DISEASE"], [2638, 2653, "DISEASE"], [2992, 3001, "DISEASE"], [3095, 3110, "DISEASE"], [3158, 3173, "DISEASE"], [3228, 3234, "DISEASE"], [3313, 3328, "DISEASE"], [3332, 3336, "DISEASE"], [3590, 3602, "DISEASE"], [3696, 3704, "DISEASE"], [4003, 4013, "DISEASE"], [4119, 4128, "DISEASE"], [4265, 4272, "DISEASE"], [155, 159, "DRUG"], [671, 682, "DRUG"], [1419, 1425, "DRUG"], [3346, 3362, "DRUG"], [3500, 3508, "DRUG"], [3546, 3553, "DRUG"], [3637, 3646, "DRUG"], [3724, 3733, "DRUG"], [3738, 3747, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nEXAM:\n  CT Abdomen &amp; Pelvis W&amp;WO Contrast\n \n\nREASON FOR EXAM: \n Status post aortobiiliac graft repair. \n \n\nTECHNIQUE: \n 5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement.  No oral or rectal contrast was utilized.  Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05.  There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP.  Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips.  The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen.  There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak.  Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either.  No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level.  There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present.  The findings are unchanged from the prior exam.  \n\nThe liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present.  There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney.  No hydronephrosis is present.  No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen. \n\nThe lung bases are clear. \n\nConcerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified.  There is prominent streak artifact from the left total hip replacement.  There is diffuse moderate sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.  The bladder grossly appears normal.  A hysterectomy has been performed.  \n\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.  No complications identified regarding endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair as described.  The findings are stable compared to the study of 10/20/04.  \n2.  Stable mild aneurysm of aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at renal artery level.  \n3.  No other acute findings noted. \n4.

He said that he was doing fine prior to that and denied having any complaints.  He was sitting watching TV and he felt sleepy.  So, he went to the bathroom to urinate before going to bed and while he was trying to lift the seat, he tripped and fell and hit his head on the back.  His head hit the toilet seat.  Then, he started having bleeding and had pain in the area with headache.  He did not lose consciousness as far as he can tell.  He went and woke up his sister.  This happened somewhere between 10:30 and 11 p.m.  His sister brought a towel and covered the laceration on the back of his head and called EMS, who came to his house and brought him to the emergency room, where he was found to have a laceration on the back of his head, which was stapled and a CT of the head was obtained and ruled out any acute intracranial pathology.  On his lab work, his ammonia was found to be markedly elevated at 106.  So, he is being admitted for management of this.  He denied having any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, GI bleed, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.  He said he has been taking his medicines, but he could not recall those.  He denied having any symptoms prior to this fall.  He said earlier today he also fell.  He also said that this was an accidental fall caused by problem with his walker.  He landed on his back at that time, but did not have any back pain afterwards.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\n1.  Liver cirrhosis caused by alcohol.  This is per the patient.\n2.  He thinks he is diabetic.\n3.  History of intracranial hemorrhage.  He said it was subdural hematoma.  This was traumatic and happened seven years ago leaving him with the right-sided hemiparesis.\n4.

He used to be a heavy drinker, quit alcohol one year ago and does not work currently.\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n  Negative for any liver disease.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n\nGENERAL:  Denies fever or chills.  He said he was in Gilbert about couple of weeks ago for fever and was admitted there for two days.  He does not know the details.\nENT:  No visual changes.  No runny nose.  No sore throat.\nCARDIOVASCULAR:  No syncope, chest pain, or palpitations.\nRESPIRATORY:  No cough or hemoptysis.  No dyspnea.\nGI:  No abdominal pain.  No nausea or vomiting.  No GI bleed.  History of alcoholic liver disease.\nGU:  No dysuria, hematuria, frequency, or urgency.\nMUSCULOSKELETAL:  Denies any acute joint pain or swelling.\nSKIN:  No new skin rashes or itching.\nCNS:  Had a seizure many years ago with no recurrences.  Left-sided hemiparesis after subdural hematoma from a fight/trauma.\nENDOCRINE:  He thinks he has diabetes but does not know if he is on any diabetic treatment.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate 83, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 125/72, and saturation 98% on room air.\nGENERAL:  The patient is lying in bed, appears comfortable, very pleasant Native American male in no apparent distress.\nHEENT:  His skull has a scar on the left side from previous surgery.  On the back of his head, there is a laceration, which has two staples on.  It is still oozing minimally.  It is tender.  No other traumatic injury is noted.  Eyes, pupils react to light.  Sclerae anicteric.  Nostrils are normal.  Oral cavity is clear with no thrush or exudate.\nNECK:  Supple.  Trachea midline.  No JVD.  No thyromegaly.\nLYMPHATICS:  No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nHEART:  Normal S1 and S2.  No murmurs or gallops.  Regular rate and rhythm.\nABDOMEN:  Soft, distended, nontender.  No organomegaly or masses.\nLOWER EXTREMITIES:  +1 edema bilaterally.  Pulses strong bilaterally.  No skin ulcerations noted.  No erythema.\nSKIN:  Several spider angiomas noted on his torso and upper extremities consistent with liver cirrhosis.\nBACK:  No tenderness by exam.\nRECTAL:  No masses.  No abscess.  No rectal fissures.  Guaiac was performed by me and it was negative.\nNEUROLOGIC:  He is alert and oriented x2.  He is slow to some extent in his response.  No asterixis.  Right-sided spastic hemiparesis with increased tone, increased reflexes, and weakness.  Increased tone noted in upper and lower extremities on the right compared to the left.  Deep tendon reflexes are +3 on the right and +2 on the left.  Muscle strength is decreased on the right, more pronounced in the lower extremity compared to the upper extremity.  The upper extremity is +4/5.  Lower extremity is 3/5.  The left side has a normal strength.  Sensation appears to be intact.  Babinski is upward on the right, equivocal on the left.\nPSYCHIATRIC:  Flat affect.  Mood appeared to be appropriate.  No active hallucinations or psychotic symptoms.\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA: \n White count 4, hemoglobin 14.2, hematocrit 40.2%, platelets 85,000, PT is 13.4, INR is 1, BUN 7.8, glucose 105, sodium 141, potassium 3.9, bicarbonate 22.3, calcium 8.7, albumin 3.6, AST 39, ALT 27, alkaline phosphatase 140, total bilirubin is 0.9, and ammonia level is 106.\n\n\nIMAGING STUDIES: \n CT of the head.  Film was reviewed.  The report mentioned, status post frontal craniotomy and a small focus of encephalomalacia involving the left frontal lobe.  This is likely consistent with residuals from his previous head injury.  There is also mild generalized atrophy and changes consistent with chronic small vessel disease.  No other findings on his CT.  The skull is unremarkable except for the surgery changes.  No acute abnormalities overall.\n\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\n1.  Hepatic encephalopathy.  Trigger is unclear at this time.  Could be noncompliance.  No evidence of GI bleed and his electrolytes are normal.  I am not sure if he is taking any sedatives, as he does not recall the medication that he is on.  The patient will be admitted to the hospital for management.  He will be started on lactulose.  I will give him 30 mL every two hours until he has a bowel movement.  Then, we will adjust the dose to target three bowel movements daily and we will monitor his ammonia level and ensure that it is trending down.  We will monitor his electrolyte and correct as needed and I will hydrate him, as hypovolemia is also a possible trigger.  We will obtain an ultrasound of his abdomen to see if there is any ascites.  At this time, there is no clinical evidence of SBP, but if he develops any fever may consider tapping his belly if there is ascites to rule out that possibility.\n2.  Thrombocytopenia likely due to cirrhosis.  We will monitor the level.  No need for transfusion at this time.\n3.  Macrocytosis also due to liver disease.  I will check his vitamin levels, however, to ensure that he does not need any supplementation.\n4.  History of diabetes as per the patient.  His glucose is 105.  This can be clarified in the morning with his primary care physician.  We will monitor his glucose for now.\n5.  Skull laceration.  This was stapled by the ER physician and we will watch it for now, appear to be stable.  No evidence of any other trauma.\n6.  We will watch him on the telemetry floor to ensure that he has no arrhythmias leading to his two falls, which appear to be incidental as per the patient.\n7.  Right-sided hemiparesis appear to be chronic and not an acute issue.  The patient already has a walker at home.\n8.  We can try to obtain more information in the morning about his past medical history, medication, etc., from his family and/or his primary care physician at Sacaton.\n\nTime spent in evaluation and management of this patient in the emergency room exceeds 70 minutes.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[542, 546, "ANATOMY"], [877, 881, "ANATOMY"], [1018, 1022, "ANATOMY"], [1058, 1062, "ANATOMY"], [1100, 1112, "ANATOMY"], [2099, 2106, "ANATOMY"], [2880, 2883, "ANATOMY"], [2938, 2952, "ANATOMY"], [3146, 3148, "ANATOMY"], [3256, 3260, "ANATOMY"], [3294, 3297, "ANATOMY"], [3779, 3784, "ANATOMY"], [3791, 3796, "ANATOMY"], [3868, 3872, "ANATOMY"], [4007, 4011, "ANATOMY"], [4013, 4019, "ANATOMY"], [4057, 4065, "ANATOMY"], [4079, 4090, "ANATOMY"], [4127, 4131, "ANATOMY"], [4143, 4150, "ANATOMY"], [4202, 4210, "ANATOMY"], [4247, 4252, "ANATOMY"], [4290, 4295, "ANATOMY"], [4366, 4373, "ANATOMY"], [4432, 4449, "ANATOMY"], [4544, 4548, "ANATOMY"], [4588, 4593, "ANATOMY"], [4598, 4615, "ANATOMY"], [4679, 4685, "ANATOMY"], [4716, 4722, "ANATOMY"], [4723, 4731, "ANATOMY"], [5006, 5023, "ANATOMY"], [5122, 5128, "ANATOMY"], [5188, 5203, "ANATOMY"], [5220, 5235, "ANATOMY"], [5242, 5257, "ANATOMY"], [5268, 5283, "ANATOMY"], [5857, 5861, "ANATOMY"], [5989, 6006, "ANATOMY"], [6157, 6169, "ANATOMY"], [6214, 6219, "ANATOMY"], [6278, 6291, "ANATOMY"], [6718, 6723, "ANATOMY"], [6781, 6786, "ANATOMY"], [7037, 7044, "ANATOMY"], [7184, 7189, "ANATOMY"], [7671, 7676, "ANATOMY"], [67, 89, "DISEASE"], [184, 201, "DISEASE"], [247, 262, "DISEASE"], [616, 624, "DISEASE"], [633, 637, "DISEASE"], [655, 663, "DISEASE"], [847, 857, "DISEASE"], [988, 998, "DISEASE"], [1113, 1122, "DISEASE"], [1268, 1282, "DISEASE"], [1284, 1306, "DISEASE"], [1308, 1316, "DISEASE"], [1318, 1329, "DISEASE"], [1331, 1337, "DISEASE"], [1452, 1460, "DISEASE"], [1549, 1564, "DISEASE"], [1658, 1667, "DISEASE"], [1709, 1724, "DISEASE"], [1815, 1838, "DISEASE"], [1856, 1873, "DISEASE"], [1957, 1968, "DISEASE"], [1991, 1998, "DISEASE"], [2031, 2039, "DISEASE"], [2165, 2177, "DISEASE"], [2217, 2240, "DISEASE"], [2241, 2258, "DISEASE"], [2360, 2369, "DISEASE"], [2542, 2552, "DISEASE"], [2571, 2584, "DISEASE"], [2678, 2691, "DISEASE"], [2741, 2747, "DISEASE"], [2909, 2919, "DISEASE"], [2958, 2965, "DISEASE"], [2967, 2977, "DISEASE"], [3022, 3032, "DISEASE"], [3038, 3045, "DISEASE"], [3085, 3093, "DISEASE"], [3099, 3107, "DISEASE"], [3121, 3144, "DISEASE"], [3154, 3161, "DISEASE"], [3232, 3242, "DISEASE"], [3246, 3254, "DISEASE"], [3270, 3281, "DISEASE"], [3285, 3292, "DISEASE"], [3306, 3313, "DISEASE"], [3337, 3348, "DISEASE"], [3362, 3373, "DISEASE"], [3380, 3397, "DISEASE"], [3411, 3417, "DISEASE"], [3448, 3456, "DISEASE"], [3803, 3807, "DISEASE"], [3885, 3895, "DISEASE"], [3936, 3942, "DISEASE"], [3979, 3995, "DISEASE"], [4108, 4114, "DISEASE"], [4173, 4184, "DISEASE"], [4214, 4245, "DISEASE"], [4455, 4460, "DISEASE"], [4506, 4522, "DISEASE"], [4566, 4574, "DISEASE"], [4632, 4647, "DISEASE"], [4659, 4669, "DISEASE"], [4703, 4710, "DISEASE"], [4872, 4881, "DISEASE"], [4896, 4915, "DISEASE"], [4961, 4969, "DISEASE"], [5434, 5445, "DISEASE"], [5492, 5506, "DISEASE"], [5510, 5528, "DISEASE"], [5958, 5974, "DISEASE"], [6068, 6079, "DISEASE"], [6113, 6120, "DISEASE"], [6170, 6177, "DISEASE"], [6318, 6322, "DISEASE"], [6329, 6351, "DISEASE"], [6428, 6436, "DISEASE"], [7275, 7284, "DISEASE"], [7357, 7369, "DISEASE"], [7382, 7395, "DISEASE"], [7508, 7516, "DISEASE"], [7677, 7687, "DISEASE"], [7804, 7810, "DISEASE"], [7913, 7918, "DISEASE"], [7986, 7997, "DISEASE"], [1146, 1153, "DRUG"], [1388, 1397, "DRUG"], [1498, 1503, "DRUG"], [1735, 1742, "DRUG"], [2262, 2273, "DRUG"], [2302, 2313, "DRUG"], [2329, 2338, "DRUG"], [2343, 2356, "DRUG"], [2373, 2381, "DRUG"], [2591, 2598, "DRUG"], [5650, 5657, "DRUG"], [5663, 5669, "DRUG"], [5675, 5684, "DRUG"], [5690, 5701, "DRUG"], [5708, 5715, "DRUG"], [6445, 6457, "DRUG"], [6505, 6514, "DRUG"], [6542, 6552, "DRUG"], [6653, 6662, "DRUG"], [6899, 6910, "DRUG"], [6944, 6951, "DRUG"], [7415, 7422, "DRUG"], [7542, 7549, "DRUG"], [7650, 7657, "DRUG"], [8175, 8185, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nSUBJECTIVE:  \nThe patient seen and examined feels better today.

The patient has a nonhealing decubitus ulcer in the left ischial region, which is quite deep.  It appears to be right down to the bone.  MRI shows findings suggestive of osteomyelitis.  The patient is being brought to operating room for debridement of this ulcer.  Procedure, indication, and risks were explained to the patient.  Consent obtained.\n\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL: \nThe patient was put in right lateral position and left buttock and ischial region was prepped and draped.  Examination at this time showed fair amount of chronic granulation tissue and scarred tissue circumferentially as well as the base of this decubitus ulcer.  This was sharply excised until bleeding and healthy tissue was obtained circumferentially as well as the base.  The ulcer does not appear to be going into the bone itself as there was a covering on the bone, which appears to be quite healthy, normal and bone itself appeared solid.\n\nI did not rongeur the bone.  The deeper portion of the excised tissue was also sent for tissue cultures.  Hemostasis was achieved with cautery and the wound was irrigated with sterile saline solution and then packed with medicated Kerlix.  Sterile dressing was applied.

The hypopharynx was normal and the upper esophageal sphincter was unremarkable.  The esophageal contour was normal, with the gastroesophageal junction located at 38 cm from the incisors.  At this point, there were several linear erosions and a sense of stricturing at 38 cm.  Below this, there was a small hiatal hernia with the hiatus noted at 42 cm from the incisors.  The mucosa within the hernia was normal.  The gastric lumen was normal with normal mucosa throughout.  The pylorus was patent permitting passage of the scope into the duodenum, which was normal through the third portion.  During withdrawal of the scope, additional views were obtained of the cardia, confirming the presence of a small hiatal hernia.  It was decided to attempt dilation of the strictured area, so an 18-mm TTS balloon was placed across the stricture and inflated to the recommended diameter.  When the balloon was fully inflated, the lumen appeared to be larger than 18 mm diameter, suggesting that the stricture was in fact not a significant one.  No stretching of the mucosa took place.  The balloon was deflated and the scope was withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room.\n\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  Esophagitis.\n2.

The hypopharynx was normal.  The esophagus had a normal upper esophageal sphincter, normal contour throughout, and a normal gastroesophageal junction viewed at 39 cm from the incisors.  There was no evidence of stricturing or extrinsic narrowing from her previous hiatal hernia repair.  There was no sign of reflux esophagitis.  On entering the gastric lumen, a large bezoar of undigested food was seen occupying much of the gastric fundus and body.  It had 2 to 3 mm diameter.  This was broken up using a scope into smaller pieces.  There was no retained gastric liquid.  The antrum appeared normal and the pylorus was patent.  The scope passed easily into the duodenum, which was normal through the second portion.

He presents today with diarrhea and bleeding.  Digital exam reveals bright red blood on the finger.  He is for exam under anesthesia and control of hemorrhage at this time.\n\n\nFINDINGS: \n There was an ulcer where most of the polypoid lesion had been excised before.  In a near total fashion the wound had opened and again there was a raw ulcer surface in between the edges of the mucosa.  There were a few discrete sites of mild oozing, which were treated with cautery and #1 suture.  No other obvious bleeding was seen.\n\n\nTECHNIQUE: \n The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operative table in supine position.  After adequate general anesthesia was induced, the patient was then placed in modified prone position.  His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor.  The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery.  There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well.  This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture.  At the completion, there was no bleeding, no oozing, it was completely dry, and we removed our retractor, and the patient was then turned and extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition. \r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[523, 528, "ANATOMY"], [536, 542, "ANATOMY"], [823, 829, "ANATOMY"], [919, 925, "ANATOMY"], [1186, 1194, "ANATOMY"], [1262, 1273, "ANATOMY"], [1300, 1304, "ANATOMY"], [1660, 1666, "ANATOMY"], [69, 77, "DISEASE"], [147, 155, "DISEASE"], [421, 429, "DISEASE"], [467, 475, "DISEASE"], [480, 488, "DISEASE"], [644, 649, "DISEASE"], [738, 743, "DISEASE"], [781, 786, "DISEASE"], [872, 878, "DISEASE"], [945, 953, "DISEASE"], [1231, 1238, "DISEASE"], [1253, 1261, "DISEASE"], [1328, 1333, "DISEASE"], [1435, 1441, "DISEASE"], [1491, 1495, "DISEASE"], [1519, 1525, "DISEASE"], [1701, 1709, "DISEASE"], [1714, 1720, "DISEASE"], [1862, 1871, "DISEASE"], [456, 461, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Umbilical hernia.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Umbilical hernia.\n\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED: \n Repair of umbilical hernia.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General.\n\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: \n None.\n\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: \n Minimal.\n\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \nThe patient was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.

She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.\n\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  \nThe patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[214, 225, "ANATOMY"], [866, 875, "ANATOMY"], [908, 915, "ANATOMY"], [936, 943, "ANATOMY"], [1046, 1055, "ANATOMY"], [1126, 1133, "ANATOMY"], [1243, 1252, "ANATOMY"], [1328, 1337, "ANATOMY"], [1392, 1410, "ANATOMY"], [1416, 1425, "ANATOMY"], [1588, 1597, "ANATOMY"], [1716, 1723, "ANATOMY"], [1744, 1760, "ANATOMY"], [1808, 1826, "ANATOMY"], [1839, 1850, "ANATOMY"], [1892, 1903, "ANATOMY"], [1955, 1964, "ANATOMY"], [2001, 2010, "ANATOMY"], [2058, 2063, "ANATOMY"], [2163, 2167, "ANATOMY"], [2231, 2235, "ANATOMY"], [2464, 2474, "ANATOMY"], [2532, 2539, "ANATOMY"], [2564, 2569, "ANATOMY"], [2609, 2620, "ANATOMY"], [2700, 2705, "ANATOMY"], [2747, 2759, "ANATOMY"], [2831, 2856, "ANATOMY"], [2920, 2927, "ANATOMY"], [3032, 3044, "ANATOMY"], [3066, 3073, "ANATOMY"], [3120, 3127, "ANATOMY"], [3353, 3357, "ANATOMY"], [3546, 3550, "ANATOMY"], [3668, 3679, "ANATOMY"], [3719, 3724, "ANATOMY"], [3742, 3747, "ANATOMY"], [3796, 3801, "ANATOMY"], [3814, 3823, "ANATOMY"], [3837, 3844, "ANATOMY"], [3961, 3972, "ANATOMY"], [4078, 4084, "ANATOMY"], [4198, 4202, "ANATOMY"], [69, 83, "DISEASE"], [114, 128, "DISEASE"], [354, 364, "DISEASE"], [837, 840, "DISEASE"], [984, 991, "DISEASE"], [1286, 1294, "DISEASE"], [1546, 1554, "DISEASE"], [3855, 3872, "DISEASE"], [3988, 3996, "DISEASE"], [4373, 4386, "DISEASE"], [1011, 1019, "DRUG"], [1197, 1201, "DRUG"], [1498, 1502, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n  Cholelithiasis; possible choledocholithiasis.   \n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Cholelithiasis.   \n\n\nTITLE OF PROCEDURE:\n  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiogram.   \n\n\nANESTHESIA:  \nGeneral with endotracheal intubation.   \n\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL: \n The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine upon the operating room table.  General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was injected through the umbilicus.  A small incision was made in the umbilicus, and a Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg, and a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed into the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port in the midline just subxiphoid, another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal, and another 5-mm port in the mid-axillary line just subcostal.  I grasped the fundus of the gallbladder and pulled it superiorly over the liver.  The gallbladder was inflamed and did appear to have acute cholecystitis.  There were some adhesions from the omentum, which were taken down.  I grabbed the infundibulum of the gallbladder and pulled it inferolaterally, and thereby splayed out the cystic duct.  The cystic duct was bluntly dissected.  I put a clip distally against the gallbladder.  I then cut a small hole in the cystic duct.  I passed an Arrow catheter into the cystic duct and inflated the balloon.  I injected dye under fluoroscopy, and I could feel the hepatic duct and the common bile duct.  There were no stones in the common bile duct.  The dye easily passed into the intestine.  I then removed the Arrow catheter.  I placed 2 clips proximally on the cystic duct, and I put an extra stitch through the duct at the very end with a Vicryl stitch to be sure that it was secured.  I put 2 clips on the cystic artery, and 1 distally, and it was divided.  I then took the gallbladder off the hepatic fossa using electrocautery.  I placed it in an Endocatch bag and removed it through the umbilicus.  I copiously irrigated out the abdomen.  I then closed the fascia of the umbilicus with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture.  I closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.

The patient was told of complications which might occur consisting of bleeding, bile peritonitis, bowel perforation, pneumothorax, or death.  The risks and benefits of the procedure were understood, and the patient signed the consent form freely.\n\nWith the patient lying in the supine position and the right hand underneath the head, an area of maximal dullness was identified in the mid-axillary location by percussion.  The area was prepped and cleaned with povidone iodine following which the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and serosal surfaces were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine down to the capsule of the liver.  Next, a small incision was made with a Bard-Parker #11 scalpel.  A 16-gauge modified Klatskin needle was inserted through the incision and into the liver on one occasion with the patient in deep expiration.  Liver cores measuring *** cm were obtained and will be sent to Pathology for routine histologic study.\n\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE COURSE AND DISPOSITION: \n The patient will remain under close observation in the medical treatment room for four to six hours and then be discharged home without medication.

The patient stated that he was at Hospital, secondary to his stroke, where he had his initial modified barium swallow study.  The patient stated that the results of that modified revealed aspiration with thin liquids only.  He is currently eating and drinking without difficulty and he feels that he can return to a regular diet with thin liquids.  A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration.\n\n\nSTUDY: \n Modified barium swallow study was performed in the radiology suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright and in a video-imaging chair throughout this assessment.\n\nTo evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, he was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3, cup sip x3); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x3); pureed consistency (teaspoon x3); solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1).\n\n\nFINDINGS\n\n\n\nORAL STAGE: \n The patient had no spillage out lips.  Oral residual after swallow with increased viscosity requiring multiple swallows to clear oral cavity.\n\nThe patient has reduced lingual retraction contributing to vallecula pooling after the swallow.  Trace premature spillage was noted with thin liquids during this assessment.\n\n\nPHARYNGEAL STAGE: \n Aspiration noted on cup sips of thin liquid.  Trace-to-mild penetration with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid during and after the swallow.  The penetration after the swallow occurred secondary to spillage on the piriform sinuses into the laryngeal vestibule.  The patient has incomplete laryngeal closure, which allowed the aspiration and penetration with thin liquids.  The patient had no aspiration or penetration occur with nectar-thick liquid, puree, and solid food.  The patient has a mildly reduced hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement that leads to incomplete epiglottic inversion that contributes to vallecula pooling.  Mild-to-moderate pooling in the vallecula after the swallow with liquids and puree, this residual did decrease with the solid feed presentation.  The patient has mild residual of pooling in the piriform sinuses after a swallow that did clear with sequential swallows.\n\n\nCERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: \n The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus.\n\n\nDIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: \n Mild aspiration with cup sips of thin liquid, penetration during and after the swallow with teaspoon amounts of thin liquid.  No aspiration or penetration occurred with thick liquid, pureed, or solid food during this assessment.\n\n\nPROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: \n With a modified diet, the patient's potential for swallowing safety is good.\n\n\nPLAN:\n\nBased on this evaluation, the following is recommended:\n1.  The patient should be on a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids to help prevent aspiration and penetration.\n2.  The patient should have unthickened water in between meals to help decrease his risk of dehydration.\n3.  The patient should complete good oral care two times a day to decrease bacterial growth in mouth.\n4.  The patient should be seated at a 90-degree angle when eating and drinking, as well as take small bites and small sips to help decrease risk of aspiration and penetration and reflux.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to evaluate the patient.  I look forward to working with him in the outpatient setting to improve his swallowing function and safety.  Outpatient skilled speech therapy is recommended for a trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy for muscle re-education, as well as to train patient to use swallowing techniques and maneuvers that should improve his swallowing function and safety.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[1195, 1199, "ANATOMY"], [1202, 1206, "ANATOMY"], [1292, 1303, "ANATOMY"], [1330, 1337, "ANATOMY"], [1365, 1374, "ANATOMY"], [1482, 1492, "ANATOMY"], [1714, 1722, "ANATOMY"], [1723, 1730, "ANATOMY"], [1740, 1759, "ANATOMY"], [1789, 1798, "ANATOMY"], [2077, 2087, "ANATOMY"], [2118, 2127, "ANATOMY"], [2170, 2179, "ANATOMY"], [2332, 2340, "ANATOMY"], [2341, 2348, "ANATOMY"], [2408, 2416, "ANATOMY"], [2451, 2477, "ANATOMY"], [3290, 3295, "ANATOMY"], [3763, 3769, "ANATOMY"], [114, 123, "DISEASE"], [137, 143, "DISEASE"], [207, 213, "DISEASE"], [1182, 1190, "DISEASE"], [1419, 1427, "DISEASE"], [1698, 1706, "DISEASE"], [2034, 2042, "DISEASE"], [2088, 2097, "DISEASE"], [2417, 2427, "DISEASE"], [2913, 2917, "DISEASE"], [3182, 3193, "DISEASE"], [3399, 3404, "DISEASE"], [3476, 3482, "DISEASE"], [3054, 3061, "DRUG"], [3130, 3135, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nOPERATION\n\n1.  Ivor-Lewis esophagogastrectomy.\n2.  Feeding jejunostomy.\n3.  Placement of two right-sided #28-French chest tubes.\n4.  Right thoracotomy.\n\n\nANESTHESIA:  \nGeneral endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube.\n\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: \n After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered.  Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed.  In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed.  The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure.  His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion.  After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus.  Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery.  The abdomen was opened.  Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor.  Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach.  In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade.  We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade.  The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk.  We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk.  Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver.  This was done and the stomach was freed up.  We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm.  We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest.  We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area.  The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen.  We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery.  The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach.  We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties.  The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement.  At this point the stomach was freely mobile.  We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube.  A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz.  We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site.  We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site.  We tied down in place.  We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel.  Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties.  After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen.  This was done with #1 Prolene.  We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl.\n\nNext, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.  The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately.  We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion.  Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery.  Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered.  The lung was deflated.  We placed standard chest retractors.  Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus.  We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein.  The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties.  As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus.  After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring.  We used an automatic pursestring and applied.  We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors.  We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus.  The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty.  Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler.  After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery.  We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall.  We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler.  This was then secured appropriately.  We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition.  We then fired the stapler.  We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology.  We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology.  Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins.  We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening.  This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures.  We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it.  Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis.  We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion.  The lung was brought up.  We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl.  Sterile dressing was applied.  The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU in good condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[159, 164, "ANATOMY"], [255, 260, "ANATOMY"], [666, 671, "ANATOMY"], [774, 791, "ANATOMY"], [996, 1005, "ANATOMY"], [1087, 1094, "ANATOMY"], [1234, 1241, "ANATOMY"], [1286, 1313, "ANATOMY"], [1342, 1349, "ANATOMY"], [1375, 1382, "ANATOMY"], [1415, 1422, "ANATOMY"], [1441, 1447, "ANATOMY"], [1495, 1512, "ANATOMY"], [1562, 1584, "ANATOMY"], [1718, 1725, "ANATOMY"], [1758, 1776, "ANATOMY"], [1818, 1827, "ANATOMY"], [1846, 1859, "ANATOMY"], [1909, 1916, "ANATOMY"], [1926, 1931, "ANATOMY"], [1994, 2001, "ANATOMY"], [2011, 2016, "ANATOMY"], [2028, 2037, "ANATOMY"], [2046, 2063, "ANATOMY"], [2087, 2094, "ANATOMY"], [2133, 2152, "ANATOMY"], [2159, 2178, "ANATOMY"], [2213, 2220, "ANATOMY"], [2241, 2258, "ANATOMY"], [2311, 2330, "ANATOMY"], [2352, 2358, "ANATOMY"], [2443, 2450, "ANATOMY"], [2588, 2595, "ANATOMY"], [2630, 2648, "ANATOMY"], [2697, 2704, "ANATOMY"], [2876, 2883, "ANATOMY"], [2905, 2919, "ANATOMY"], [3009, 3013, "ANATOMY"], [3084, 3091, "ANATOMY"], [3168, 3172, "ANATOMY"], [3252, 3260, "ANATOMY"], [3485, 3491, "ANATOMY"], [3558, 3562, "ANATOMY"], [3601, 3605, "ANATOMY"], [3660, 3664, "ANATOMY"], [3699, 3704, "ANATOMY"], [3739, 3749, "ANATOMY"], [3759, 3768, "ANATOMY"], [3788, 3797, "ANATOMY"], [3816, 3827, "ANATOMY"], [3834, 3845, "ANATOMY"], [3956, 3965, "ANATOMY"], [4232, 4239, "ANATOMY"], [4360, 4369, "ANATOMY"], [4453, 4460, "ANATOMY"], [4529, 4536, "ANATOMY"], [4664, 4676, "ANATOMY"], [4812, 4818, "ANATOMY"], [4899, 4908, "ANATOMY"], [4922, 4929, "ANATOMY"], [4980, 4996, "ANATOMY"], [5052, 5066, "ANATOMY"], [5282, 5289, "ANATOMY"], [5357, 5373, "ANATOMY"], [5374, 5385, "ANATOMY"], [5395, 5400, "ANATOMY"], [5432, 5438, "ANATOMY"], [5480, 5485, "ANATOMY"], [5562, 5573, "ANATOMY"], [5595, 5600, "ANATOMY"], [5664, 5668, "ANATOMY"], [5700, 5706, "ANATOMY"], [5707, 5713, "ANATOMY"], [5814, 5818, "ANATOMY"], [866, 873, "DISEASE"], [3331, 3340, "DISEASE"], [4951, 4960, "DISEASE"], [5010, 5019, "DISEASE"], [5839, 5846, "DISEASE"], [6055, 6064, "DISEASE"], [58, 62, "DRUG"], [1466, 1470, "DRUG"], [1625, 1629, "DRUG"], [2295, 2299, "DRUG"], [2373, 2377, "DRUG"], [2823, 2827, "DRUG"], [2930, 2934, "DRUG"], [3873, 3877, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: \n Gastrointestinal bleed.\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  \nMs. XYZ is an 81-year-old who presented to the emergency room after having multiple black tarry stools and a weak spell.

The patient presented to the emergency room last evening with approximately 7- to 8-day history of abdominal pain which has been persistent.  She was seen 3 to 4 days ago at ABC ER and underwent evaluation and discharged and had a CT scan at that time and she was told it was &amp;quot;normal.&amp;quot;  She was given oral antibiotics of Cipro and Flagyl.  She has had no nausea and vomiting, but has had persistent associated anorexia.  She is passing flatus, but had some obstipation symptoms with the last bowel movement two days ago.  She denies any bright red blood per rectum and no history of recent melena.  Her last colonoscopy was approximately 5 years ago with Dr. Y. She has had no definite fevers or chills and no history of jaundice.  The patient denies any significant recent weight loss.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  \nSignificant for history of atrial fibrillation, under good control and now in normal sinus rhythm and on metoprolol and also on Premarin hormone replacement.\n\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: \n Significant for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy.  She has a long history of known grade 4 bladder prolapse and she has been seen in the past by Dr. Chip Winkel, I believe that he has not been re-consulted.\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n SHE IS ALLERGIC OR SENSITIVE TO MACRODANTIN.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \n She does not drink or smoke.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: \n Otherwise negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n\nGENERAL:  The patient is an elderly thin white female, very pleasant, in no acute distress.\nVITAL SIGNS:  Her temperature is 98.8 and vital signs are all stable, within normal limits.\nHEENT:  Head is grossly atraumatic and normocephalic.  Sclerae are anicteric.  The conjunctivae are non-injected.\nNECK:  Supple.\nCHEST:  Clear.\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.\nABDOMEN:  Generally nondistended and soft.  She is focally tender in the left lower quadrant to deep palpation with a palpable fullness or mass and focally tender, but no rebound tenderness.  There is no CVA or flank tenderness, although some very minimal left flank tenderness.\nPELVIC:  Currently deferred, but has history of grade 4 urinary bladder prolapse.\nEXTREMITIES:  Grossly and neurovascularly intact.\n\n\nLABORATORY VALUES:  \nWhite blood cell count is 5.3, hemoglobin 12.8, and platelet count normal.  Alkaline phosphatase elevated at 184.  Liver function tests otherwise normal.  Electrolytes normal.  Glucose 134, BUN 4, and creatinine 0.7.\n\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:\n  EKG shows normal sinus rhythm.\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: \n A 71-year-old female with greater than one-week history of abdominal pain now more localized to the left lower quadrant.  Currently is a nonacute abdomen.  The working diagnosis would be sigmoid diverticulitis.  She does have a history in the distant past of sigmoid diverticulitis.  I would recommend a repeat stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and keep the patient nothing by mouth.  The patient was seen 5 years ago by Dr. Y in Colorectal Surgery.  We will consult her also for evaluation.  The patient will need repeat colonoscopy in the near future and be kept nothing by mouth now empirically.  The case was discussed with the patient's primary care physician, Dr. X. Again, currently there is no indication for acute surgical intervention on today's date, although the patient will need close observation and further diagnostic workup.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[483, 487, "ANATOMY"], [674, 679, "ANATOMY"], [1832, 1837, "ANATOMY"], [1840, 1844, "ANATOMY"], [1946, 1950, "ANATOMY"], [1961, 1966, "ANATOMY"], [1976, 1981, "ANATOMY"], [2009, 2016, "ANATOMY"], [2265, 2275, "ANATOMY"], [2288, 2294, "ANATOMY"], [2370, 2381, "ANATOMY"], [2886, 2893, "ANATOMY"], [2927, 2934, "ANATOMY"], [2999, 3006, "ANATOMY"], [3071, 3089, "ANATOMY"], [62, 76, "DISEASE"], [263, 277, "DISEASE"], [537, 556, "DISEASE"], [548, 556, "DISEASE"], [592, 600, "DISEASE"], [610, 624, "DISEASE"], [639, 650, "DISEASE"], [651, 659, "DISEASE"], [772, 778, "DISEASE"], [878, 884, "DISEASE"], [1286, 1302, "DISEASE"], [1404, 1413, "DISEASE"], [1424, 1432, "DISEASE"], [1576, 1585, "DISEASE"], [1587, 1598, "DISEASE"], [1602, 1621, "DISEASE"], [2180, 2198, "DISEASE"], [2213, 2216, "DISEASE"], [2220, 2236, "DISEASE"], [2270, 2286, "DISEASE"], [2276, 2286, "DISEASE"], [2732, 2736, "DISEASE"], [2799, 2813, "DISEASE"], [2935, 2949, "DISEASE"], [3007, 3021, "DISEASE"], [488, 499, "DRUG"], [503, 508, "DRUG"], [513, 519, "DRUG"], [1054, 1061, "DRUG"], [1100, 1110, "DRUG"], [1123, 1131, "DRUG"], [1449, 1460, "DRUG"], [2620, 2627, "DRUG"], [3493, 3498, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.

Status post Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n\nPROCEDURE PERFORMED:\n  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies.\n\n\nINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: \n This is a 55-year-old African-American female who had undergone Whipple's procedure approximately five to six years ago for a benign pancreatic mass.  The patient has pancreatic insufficiency and is already on replacement.  She is currently using Nexium.  She has continued postprandial dyspepsia and reflux symptoms.  To evaluate this, the patient was boarded for EGD.  The patient gave informed consent for the procedure.\n\n\nGROSS FINDINGS: \n At the time of EGD, the patient was found to have alkaline reflux gastritis.  There was no evidence of distal esophagitis.  Gastroparesis was seen as there was retained fluid in the small intestine.  The patient had no evidence of anastomotic obstruction and appeared to have a Billroth II reconstruction by gastric jejunostomy.  Biopsies were taken and further recommendations will follow.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:  \nThe patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite.  The heart and lungs examination were unremarkable.  The vital signs were monitored and found to be stable throughout the procedure.  The patient's oropharynx was anesthetized with Cetacaine spray.  She was placed in left lateral position.  The patient had the video Olympus GIF gastroscope model inserted per os and was advanced without difficulty through the hypopharynx.  GE junction was in normal position.  There was no evidence of any hiatal hernia.  There was no evidence of distal esophagitis.  The gastric remnant was entered.  It was noted to be inflamed with alkaline reflux gastritis.  The anastomosis was open and patent.  The small intestine was entered.  There was retained fluid material in the stomach and small intestine and _______ gastroparesis.  Biopsies were performed.  Insufflated air was removed with withdrawal of the scope.  The patient's diet will be adjusted to postgastrectomy-type diet.  Biopsies performed.  Diet will be reviewed.  The patient will have an upper GI series performed to rule out more distal type obstruction explaining the retained fluid versus gastroparesis.  Reglan will also be added.

General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.\n\nA 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made.  The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp.  A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident.  Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening.  Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg.\n\nThe remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar.  A total of 3 other trocars were placed.  The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position.  The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 3 cm above the anterior superior iliac spine.  The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars.  All of the trocars were placed without difficulty.\n\nThe patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder.  A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free.\n\nA laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct close to the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was then grasped through the upper midline cannula and a fine-tipped scissors introduced through the third cannula and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct near the clips.  Several attempts at passing the cholangiocatheter into the ductotomy were made.  Despite numerous attempts at several angles, the cholangiocatheter could not be inserted into the cystic duct.  After several such attempts, and due to the fact that the anatomy was clear, we aborted any further attempts at cholangiography.  The distal cystic duct was doubly clipped.  The duct was divided between the clips.  The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.\n\nThe cystic artery was found medially and slightly posteriorly to the cystic duct.  It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues.  A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally.  The artery was divided between the clips.  The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine.\n\nAfter the cystic duct and artery were transected, the gallbladder was dissected from the liver bed using Bovie electrocautery.  Prior to complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver, the peritoneal cavity was copiously irrigated with saline and the operative field was examined for persistent blood or bile leaks of which there were none.\n\nAfter the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula.  The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula.  As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen.  The neck of the gallbladder was then secured with a Kocher clamp, and the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen.\n\nFollowing gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen.\n\nBoth midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture.  All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied.  Dressings were applied.  All surgical counts were reported as correct.\n\nHaving tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[468, 474, "ANATOMY"], [495, 514, "ANATOMY"], [523, 529, "ANATOMY"], [577, 583, "ANATOMY"], [608, 624, "ANATOMY"], [718, 724, "ANATOMY"], [835, 842, "ANATOMY"], [1007, 1014, "ANATOMY"], [1104, 1118, "ANATOMY"], [1134, 1154, "ANATOMY"], [1162, 1168, "ANATOMY"], [1224, 1238, "ANATOMY"], [1422, 1444, "ANATOMY"], [1474, 1503, "ANATOMY"], [1768, 1779, "ANATOMY"], [1868, 1882, "ANATOMY"], [1952, 1959, "ANATOMY"], [2136, 2143, "ANATOMY"], [2174, 2185, "ANATOMY"], [2199, 2210, "ANATOMY"], [2217, 2228, "ANATOMY"], [2272, 2279, "ANATOMY"], [2336, 2343, "ANATOMY"], [2386, 2397, "ANATOMY"], [2594, 2605, "ANATOMY"], [2666, 2673, "ANATOMY"], [2749, 2760, "ANATOMY"], [2786, 2790, "ANATOMY"], [2896, 2912, "ANATOMY"], [2969, 2982, "ANATOMY"], [3034, 3045, "ANATOMY"], [3101, 3108, "ANATOMY"], [3180, 3187, "ANATOMY"], [3218, 3231, "ANATOMY"], [3262, 3268, "ANATOMY"], [3361, 3372, "ANATOMY"], [3377, 3383, "ANATOMY"], [3405, 3416, "ANATOMY"], [3440, 3445, "ANATOMY"], [3515, 3526, "ANATOMY"], [3536, 3541, "ANATOMY"], [3547, 3564, "ANATOMY"], [3653, 3658, "ANATOMY"], [3737, 3748, "ANATOMY"], [3758, 3763, "ANATOMY"], [3837, 3844, "ANATOMY"], [3851, 3855, "ANATOMY"], [3863, 3874, "ANATOMY"], [3939, 3948, "ANATOMY"], [3962, 3969, "ANATOMY"], [3979, 3990, "ANATOMY"], [4014, 4023, "ANATOMY"], [4024, 4031, "ANATOMY"], [4092, 4099, "ANATOMY"], [4106, 4110, "ANATOMY"], [4118, 4129, "ANATOMY"], [4176, 4187, "ANATOMY"], [4209, 4216, "ANATOMY"], [4301, 4308, "ANATOMY"], [4324, 4331, "ANATOMY"], [4378, 4384, "ANATOMY"], [4391, 4395, "ANATOMY"], [4472, 4476, "ANATOMY"], [397, 404, "DISEASE"], [775, 781, "DISEASE"], [853, 869, "DISEASE"], [1961, 1967, "DISEASE"], [2864, 2873, "DISEASE"], [3662, 3672, "DISEASE"], [3719, 3729, "DISEASE"], [4733, 4742, "DISEASE"], [1329, 1333, "DRUG"], [2954, 2962, "DRUG"], [3340, 3348, "DRUG"], [4494, 4501, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROCEDURE:\n  Gastroscopy.\n\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n  Dysphagia and globus.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Normal.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n  MAC.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: \n The Olympus gastroscope was introduced through the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus and stomach, and then through the gastrojejunal anastomosis into the efferent jejunal loop.  The preparation was good and all surfaces were well seen.  The hypopharynx was normal with no evidence of inflammation.  The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout with no sign of stricturing or inflammation or exudate.  The GE junction was located at 39 cm from the incisors and appeared normal with no evidence of reflux, damage, or Barrett's.  Below this there was a small gastric pouch measuring 6 cm with intact mucosa and no retained food.  The gastrojejunal anastomosis was patent measuring about 12 mm, with no inflammation or ulceration.

The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen.  The hypopharynx appeared normal.  The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout its distance, but at the distal end, there was a moderate-sized hiatal hernia noted.  The GE junction was seen at 40 cm and the hiatus was noted at 44 cm from the incisors.  Above the GE junction, there were three fingers of columnar epithelium extending cephalad, to a distance of about 2 cm.  This appears to be consistent with Barrett esophagus.  Multiple biopsies were taken from numerous areas in this region.  There was no active ulceration or inflammation and no stricture.  The hiatal hernia sac had normal mucosa except for one small erosion at the hiatus.  The gastric body had normal mucosa throughout.  Numerous small fundic gland polyps were noted, measuring 3 to 5 mm in size with an entirely benign appearance.  Biopsies were taken from the antrum to rule out Helicobacter pylori.  A retroflex view of the cardia and fundus confirmed the small hiatal hernia and demonstrated no additional lesions.  The scope was passed through the pylorus, which was patent and normal.  The mucosa throughout the duodenum in the first, second, and third portions was entirely normal.  The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to the recovery room.  He tolerated the procedure well.\n\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.  A short-segment Barrett esophagus.\n2.  Hiatal hernia.\n3.  Incidental fundic gland polyps in the gastric body.\n4.  Otherwise, normal upper endoscopy to the transverse duodenum.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1.  Follow up biopsy report.\n2.  Continue PPI therapy.\n3.  Follow up with Dr. X as needed.\n4.  Surveillance endoscopy for Barrett in 3 years (if pathology confirms this diagnosis).\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[263, 273, "ANATOMY"], [307, 316, "ANATOMY"], [318, 325, "ANATOMY"], [331, 339, "ANATOMY"], [358, 366, "ANATOMY"], [437, 448, "ANATOMY"], [471, 480, "ANATOMY"], [513, 519, "ANATOMY"], [595, 608, "ANATOMY"], [621, 623, "ANATOMY"], [694, 702, "ANATOMY"], [715, 717, "ANATOMY"], [745, 752, "ANATOMY"], [756, 775, "ANATOMY"], [1017, 1030, "ANATOMY"], [1024, 1034, "ANATOMY"], [1046, 1052, "ANATOMY"], [1074, 1081, "ANATOMY"], [1102, 1114, "ANATOMY"], [1126, 1132, "ANATOMY"], [1287, 1293, "ANATOMY"], [1352, 1358, "ANATOMY"], [1363, 1369, "ANATOMY"], [1390, 1403, "ANATOMY"], [1478, 1485, "ANATOMY"], [1521, 1527, "ANATOMY"], [1543, 1551, "ANATOMY"], [1783, 1796, "ANATOMY"], [1840, 1852, "ANATOMY"], [1910, 1918, "ANATOMY"], [97, 128, "DISEASE"], [159, 176, "DISEASE"], [861, 878, "DISEASE"], [967, 977, "DISEASE"], [981, 993, "DISEASE"], [1001, 1010, "DISEASE"], [1161, 1180, "DISEASE"], [1306, 1318, "DISEASE"], [1306, 1325, "DISEASE"], [1760, 1777, "DISEASE"], [1813, 1832, "DISEASE"], [2085, 2094, "DISEASE"], [180, 191, "DRUG"], [1982, 1985, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Colon polyps.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.

A CT scan of his abdomen showed evidence of appendicitis with perforation.  He was evaluated in the Emergency Department and placed on the appendicitis critical pathway for this acute appendicitis process.  He required several boluses of fluid for tachycardia and evidence of dehydration.\n\nI met with Carlos' parents and talked to them about the diagnosis of appendicis and surgical risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options.  All their questions have been answered and they agree with the surgical plan.\n\n\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS: \n The patient had acute perforated appendicitis with diffuse suppurative peritonitis including multiple intraloop abscesses and purulent debris in all quadrants of the abdomen including the perihepatic and subphrenic recesses as well.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: \n The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  A Foley catheter was placed for decompression, and his abdomen was prepared and draped in a standard fashion.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated in the soft tissues around his umbilicus and in the suprapubic and left lower quadrant locations chosen for trocar insertion.  We conducted our surgical timeout and reiterated all of Carlos' unique and important identifying information and confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis and planned laparoscopic appendectomy as the procedure.  A 1-cm vertical infraumbilical incision was made and an open technique was used to place a 12-mm Step trocar through the umbilical fascia.  CO2 was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg and then two additional 5-mm working ports were placed in areas that had been previously anesthetized.\n\nThere was a lot of diffuse purulent debris and adhesions between the omentum and adjacent surfaces of the bowel and the parietal peritoneum.  After these were gently separated, we began to identify the appendix.  In the __________ due to the large amount of small bowel dilatation and distension, I used the hook cautery with the lowest intraperitoneal __________ profile to coagulate the mesoappendix.  The base of the appendix was then ligated with 2-0 PDS Endoloops, and the appendix was amputated and withdrawn through the umbilical port.  I spent the next 10 minutes irrigating purulent fluid and debris from the peritoneal cavity using 2 L of sterile crystalloid solution and a suction power irrigation system.  When this was complete, the CO2 was released one final time and as much of the fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity as possible.  The umbilical fascia was closed with figure-of-eight suture of 0 Monocryl and the skin incisions were closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  His blood loss was less than 10 mL, and he received only crystalloid fluid during the procedure.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[634, 641, "ANATOMY"], [1321, 1328, "ANATOMY"], [1359, 1369, "ANATOMY"], [1568, 1575, "ANATOMY"], [1664, 1676, "ANATOMY"], [1688, 1697, "ANATOMY"], [1709, 1719, "ANATOMY"], [2115, 2131, "ANATOMY"], [2352, 2359, "ANATOMY"], [2389, 2394, "ANATOMY"], [2403, 2422, "ANATOMY"], [2485, 2493, "ANATOMY"], [2672, 2684, "ANATOMY"], [2703, 2711, "ANATOMY"], [2761, 2769, "ANATOMY"], [2810, 2819, "ANATOMY"], [2901, 2918, "ANATOMY"], [3107, 3124, "ANATOMY"], [3143, 3159, "ANATOMY"], [3192, 3198, "ANATOMY"], [3221, 3225, "ANATOMY"], [69, 104, "DISEASE"], [135, 170, "DISEASE"], [323, 327, "DISEASE"], [426, 438, "DISEASE"], [538, 541, "DISEASE"], [603, 614, "DISEASE"], [661, 690, "DISEASE"], [756, 768, "DISEASE"], [795, 813, "DISEASE"], [893, 904, "DISEASE"], [1171, 1200, "DISEASE"], [1214, 1237, "DISEASE"], [1267, 1276, "DISEASE"], [1924, 1936, "DISEASE"], [2330, 2339, "DISEASE"], [2568, 2578, "DISEASE"], [2738, 2741, "DISEASE"], [2932, 2939, "DISEASE"], [3404, 3413, "DISEASE"], [3420, 3430, "DISEASE"], [494, 513, "DRUG"], [555, 560, "DRUG"], [909, 912, "DRUG"], [1632, 1640, "DRUG"], [2083, 2087, "DRUG"], [2940, 2951, "DRUG"], [3473, 3484, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Esophageal foreign body.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n  Esophageal foreign body, US penny.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n Esophagoscopy with foreign body removal.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General.\n\n\nINDICATIONS: \n The patient is a 17-month-old baby girl with biliary atresia, who had a delayed diagnosis and a late attempted Kasai portoenterostomy, which failed.  The patient has progressive cholestatic jaundice and is on the liver transplant list at ABCD.  The patient is fed by mouth and also with nasogastric enteral feeding supplements.  She has had an __________ cough and relatively disinterested in oral intake for the past month.  She was recently in the GI Clinic and an x-ray was ordered to check her tube placement and an incidental finding of a coin in the proximal esophagus was noted.  Based on the history, it is quite possible this coin has been there close to a month.  She is brought to the operating room now for attempted removal.  I met with the parents and talked to them at length about the procedure and the increased risk in a child with a coin that has been in for a prolonged period of time.  Hopefully, there will be no coin migration or significant irrigation that would require prolonged hospitalization.\n\n\nOPERATIVE FINDINGS: \n The patient had a penny lodged in the proximal esophagus in the typical location.  There was no evidence of external migration and surrounding irritation was noted, but did not appear to be excessive.  The coin actually came out with relative ease after which endoscopically identified.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: \n The patient came to the operating room and had induction of general anesthesia.  She was slow to respond to the usual propofol and other inducing agents and may be has some difficulty with tolerance or __________ tolerance to these medications.  After her endotracheal tube was placed and securely taped to the left side of her mouth, I positioned the patient with a prominent shoulder roll and neck hyperextension and then used the laryngoscope to elevate the tiny glottic mechanism.  A rigid esophagoscope was then inserted into the proximal esophagus, and the scope was gradually advanced with the lumen directly in frontal view.  This was facilitated by the nasoenteric feeding tube that was in place, which I followed carefully until the edge of the coin could be seen.  At this location, there was quite a bit of surrounding mucosal inflammation, but the coin edge could be clearly seen and was secured with the coin grasping forceps.  I then withdrew the scope, forceps, and the coin as one unit, and it was easily retrieved.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no intraoperative complications.  There was only one single coin noted, and she was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[523, 528, "ANATOMY"], [543, 554, "ANATOMY"], [649, 653, "ANATOMY"], [821, 830, "ANATOMY"], [1349, 1358, "ANATOMY"], [1947, 1952, "ANATOMY"], [1996, 2004, "ANATOMY"], [2014, 2018, "ANATOMY"], [2085, 2092, "ANATOMY"], [2163, 2172, "ANATOMY"], [2220, 2225, "ANATOMY"], [69, 92, "DISEASE"], [123, 146, "DISEASE"], [434, 454, "DISEASE"], [611, 616, "DISEASE"], [2019, 2033, "DISEASE"], [2107, 2112, "DISEASE"], [2450, 2470, "DISEASE"], [2710, 2738, "DISEASE"], [2839, 2848, "DISEASE"], [271, 275, "DRUG"], [997, 1000, "DRUG"], [1737, 1745, "DRUG"], [1851, 1862, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Blood loss anemia.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.

She has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss.  She has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months.  After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids.  The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated.  The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum.  There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Air was aspirated.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed.  There was no evidence of perianal disease.  No source of the anemia was identified.\n\nAttention was then taken for performing an EGD.  The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx.  The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed.  There were no abnormalities of the esophagus.  The stomach was entered and was insufflated.  The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum.  Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______.  It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm.  Several biopsies were taken.  The mass was soft.  The pylorus was then entered.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined.  There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed.  In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation.  There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps.  Biopsy was also taken for CLO.  A hiatal hernia was present as well.  Air was aspirated.  The scope was slowly withdrawn.  The GE junction was unremarkable.  The scope was fully withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will undergo a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes.

Digital rectal examination was done, which was normal.  Endoscope was introduced and passed through a rather spastic tortuous sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula seen all the way through transverse colon where about 1 cm x 1 cm sessile polyp was seen.  It was biopsied and then in piecemeal fashion removed using snare polypectomy after base was infiltrated with epinephrine.  Pedunculated polyp next to it was hard to see and there was a lot of peristalsis.  The scope then was advanced through rest of the transverse colon to ascending colon and cecum.  Terminal ileum was briefly reviewed, appeared normal and so did cecum after copious amount of fecal material was irrigated out.  Ascending colon was unremarkable.  At hepatic flexure may be proximal transverse colon, there was a sessile polyp about 1.2 cm x 1 cm that was removed in the same manner with a biopsy taken, base infiltrated with epinephrine and at least two passes of snare polypectomy and subsequent hot biopsy cautery removed to hold polypoid tissue, which could be seen.  In transverse colon on withdrawal and relaxation with epinephrine, an additional 1 mm to 2 mm sessile polyp was removed by hot biopsy.  Then in the transverse colon, additional larger polyp about 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm was removed in piecemeal fashion again with epinephrine, sclerotherapy, and snare polypectomy.  Subsequently pedunculated polyp in distal transverse colon near splenic flexure was removed with snare polypectomy.  The rest of the splenic flexure and descending colon were unremarkable.  Diverticulosis was again seen with almost constant spasm despite of glucagon.  Sigmoid colon did somewhat hinder the inspection of that area.  Rectum, retroflexion posterior anal canal showed internal hemorrhoids moderate to large.  Excess of air insufflated was removed.  The endoscope was withdrawn.\n\n\nPLAN: \n Await biopsy report.

After signing the informed consent, premedications were given.  The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and monitored with blood pressure cuff and pulse oximeter throughout the procedure.  Hurricaine spray was placed in the back of the throat.  The Olympus endoscope was passed under direct visualization through the cricopharyngeus into the esophageal area.  It was passed through the esophagus with identification of the EG junction and into the stomach.  A portion of the stomach and the rugal folds were visualized.  The scope was passed into the antral area with visualization of the pylorus.  The pylorus was cannulated and the duodenal bulb and the second position of the duodenum were visualized.  The scope was passed back into the stomach where the cardia, fundus, and lesser curvature were visualized in a retrograde manner.  The following findings were noted:  \n\n\nFINDINGS:  \n\n1.  The esophagus was significantly tortuous and somewhat shortened with a large hiatal hernia with the EG junction at approximately 30 cm.  It was difficult to tell if there was significant narrowing in the esophagus with the significant tortuosity and the scope passing into the stomach.  No resistance was noted to the endoscope.\n2.  The stomach was abnormal with a very large sliding type hiatal hernia.\n3.  The duodenum was normal.\n4.  A Savary wire was placed in the antrum and the scope was removed.  Positioning the wire by markings, a #14 French dilator was passed without difficulty into the stomach area.  There was some resistance to a #16 French dilator, although at that time it had passed to approximately 40 cm and I suspect we were through the EG junction area.  This may have been curling in the hiatal hernia, I opted not to use further force to advance the dilator further.\n\nThe scope was removed and the patient tolerated the procedure well.  \n\n\nIMPRESSION: \n Very large hiatal hernia and tortuous esophagus, probably with mild peptic stricture, dilated to #14 French.  I may even have gotten the #16 French dilator through, but it was not passed all the way into the stomach area because of some resistance which I suspect was curling in the hiatal hernia.\n\n\nPLAN:\n  I will have her follow up with my nurse practitioner in approximately 10 days.  If her dysphagia is improved, we will simply observe.  If she continues to have dysphagia, we will bring her back and attempt to re-dilate her with a #15 French dilator.

The duodenum appeared normal.  The scope was then brought back to the stomach.  The antrum and angularis appeared normal as well.  The scope was retroflexed to visualize the mucosa of rugal folds, the body, and fundus of the stomach.  At the cardia, there was a large fungating ulcerated mass appreciated, which was oozing blood.  Biopsies were taken of this mass, which was very firm and likely representing a carcinoma.  The scope was then anteflexed and brought back to the distal esophagus.

After having obtained an informed consent, he was placed in the operating room and under anesthesia.  Followed by a time-out process, his abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Antibiotics had been given prior to incision.  A McBurney incision was performed and it carried out through the peritoneal cavity.  Immediately there was  purulent material seen in the area.  Samples were taken for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic sets.  The appendix was markedly swollen particularly in its distal three-fourth, where the distal appendix showed an abscess formation and devitalization of the wall.  There was quite a bit of local peritonitis.  The mesoappendix was clamped, divided and ligated, and then the appendix was ligated and divided, and the stump buried with a pursestring suture of Vicryl and then a Z stitch.  The area was abundantly irrigated with normal saline and also the pelvis.  The distal foot of small bowel had been explored and because it delivered itself __________ the incision and showed no pathology.\n\nThen the peritoneal and internal fascia were approximated with a suture of 0 Vicryl and then the incision was closed in layers and after each layer the wound was irrigated with normal saline.  The skin was closed with a combination of a subcuticular suture of fine Monocryl followed by the application of Dermabond.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was minimal, and the patient was sent to the recovery room for recovery in satisfactory condition.\n\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[417, 431, "ANATOMY"], [590, 607, "ANATOMY"], [753, 761, "ANATOMY"], [841, 849, "ANATOMY"], [960, 972, "ANATOMY"], [1020, 1028, "ANATOMY"], [1062, 1067, "ANATOMY"], [1094, 1100, "ANATOMY"], [1199, 1205, "ANATOMY"], [1219, 1223, "ANATOMY"], [1227, 1238, "ANATOMY"], [1348, 1358, "ANATOMY"], [1363, 1378, "ANATOMY"], [1404, 1410, "ANATOMY"], [1459, 1465, "ANATOMY"], [1536, 1540, "ANATOMY"], [1589, 1595, "ANATOMY"], [69, 87, "DISEASE"], [118, 136, "DISEASE"], [138, 148, "DISEASE"], [942, 953, "DISEASE"], [1327, 1336, "DISEASE"], [1491, 1496, "DISEASE"], [1808, 1817, "DISEASE"], [478, 489, "DRUG"], [1172, 1185, "DRUG"], [1516, 1529, "DRUG"], [1644, 1653, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Acute appendicitis.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Acute appendicitis.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n Laparoscopic appendectomy.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: \n General endotracheal.\n\n\nINDICATIONS: \n Patient is a pleasant 31-year-old gentleman who presented to the hospital with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain.  History as well as signs and symptoms are consistent with acute appendicitis as was his CAT scan.  I evaluated the patient in the emergency room and recommended that he undergo the above-named procedure.  The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable with surgery.\n\n\nFINDINGS: \n Patient was found to have acute appendicitis with an inflamed appendix, which was edematous, but essentially no suppuration.\n\n\nTECHNIQUE:  \nThe patient was identified and then taken into the operating room, where after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline.  The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection.  A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained.  Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed.  The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's.  A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum.  The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples.  The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity.  The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated.  Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum.  All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution.  The infraumbilical defect was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture.  The remaining wounds were irrigated and then everything was closed subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips.

These dense adhesions were associated with chronic inflammatory edematous changes.  The cystic duct was easily identifiable and seen entering into the gallbladder and clipped two proximally and one distally.  The cystic artery was an anomalous branch that was anterior to the cystic duct and was identified, clipped with two clips proximally and one distally.  The remainder of the evaluation of the abdomen revealed no evidence of nodularity or masses in the liver.  There was no evidence of adhesions from the abdominal wall to the liver.  The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable.\n\n\nBRIEF HISTORY:  \nThis is a 17-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/2003 with complaints of intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain.  She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously.  Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia.  She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile; however, she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy's sign and voluntary guarding with examination.  Her transaminases were markedly elevated.  She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones.  Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening, but evidence of cholelithiasis.  She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis.  Following this, she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Her parents were explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure.  She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery.\n\n\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  \nThe patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position.  Preoperatively, the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef, sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin.  The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  Utilizing a #15 blade scalpel, a transverse infraumbilical incision was created.  Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty.  The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon-dioxide.  Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a #10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty.  Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings.  The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed.  A #15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline.  The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament.  Next, two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line.  These were inserted without difficulty.  The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder.  Utilizing Endoshears scissor, a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions.  Next, the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct.  A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch.  This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place.  Next, the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly.  Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor.\nOnce the clips were noted to be in place, utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall.  The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery.  The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline.  The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port.  There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder.  Once the abdomen was re-insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed, all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall.  Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, a figure-of-eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty.  The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia.  A #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions.  The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0.25% Marcaine.  All ports were then cleaned dry.  Steri-Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this.  The patient tolerated the entire procedure well.  She was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition.  She will be followed closely in the postoperative course in General Medical Floor.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[317, 328, "ANATOMY"], [446, 457, "ANATOMY"], [566, 577, "ANATOMY"], [629, 640, "ANATOMY"], [691, 704, "ANATOMY"], [754, 765, "ANATOMY"], [878, 885, "ANATOMY"], [938, 943, "ANATOMY"], [990, 1004, "ANATOMY"], [1012, 1017, "ANATOMY"], [1041, 1048, "ANATOMY"], [1222, 1246, "ANATOMY"], [1688, 1704, "ANATOMY"], [2384, 2391, "ANATOMY"], [2608, 2631, "ANATOMY"], [2869, 2876, "ANATOMY"], [2940, 2947, "ANATOMY"], [3023, 3030, "ANATOMY"], [3406, 3413, "ANATOMY"], [3499, 3517, "ANATOMY"], [3754, 3765, "ANATOMY"], [3814, 3825, "ANATOMY"], [3915, 3926, "ANATOMY"], [4033, 4045, "ANATOMY"], [4088, 4099, "ANATOMY"], [4104, 4116, "ANATOMY"], [4142, 4153, "ANATOMY"], [4236, 4244, "ANATOMY"], [4379, 4390, "ANATOMY"], [4566, 4577, "ANATOMY"], [4744, 4755, "ANATOMY"], [4764, 4769, "ANATOMY"], [4785, 4796, "ANATOMY"], [4835, 4851, "ANATOMY"], [4900, 4907, "ANATOMY"], [4971, 4982, "ANATOMY"], [5002, 5013, "ANATOMY"], [5105, 5116, "ANATOMY"], [5128, 5135, "ANATOMY"], [5174, 5185, "ANATOMY"], [5317, 5340, "ANATOMY"], [5363, 5369, "ANATOMY"], [5437, 5443, "ANATOMY"], [5587, 5593, "ANATOMY"], [5610, 5616, "ANATOMY"], [68, 90, "DISEASE"], [121, 143, "DISEASE"], [332, 345, "DISEASE"], [490, 499, "DISEASE"], [529, 541, "DISEASE"], [542, 551, "DISEASE"], [738, 746, "DISEASE"], [971, 980, "DISEASE"], [1237, 1251, "DISEASE"], [1247, 1251, "DISEASE"], [1329, 1333, "DISEASE"], [1375, 1383, "DISEASE"], [1471, 1496, "DISEASE"], [1527, 1540, "DISEASE"], [1645, 1657, "DISEASE"], [1671, 1681, "DISEASE"], [1778, 1792, "DISEASE"], [1892, 1902, "DISEASE"], [1916, 1935, "DISEASE"], [2069, 2082, "DISEASE"], [2429, 2436, "DISEASE"], [2583, 2591, "DISEASE"], [2704, 2711, "DISEASE"], [3625, 3633, "DISEASE"], [3744, 3753, "DISEASE"], [3977, 3986, "DISEASE"], [4126, 4134, "DISEASE"], [4472, 4480, "DISEASE"], [4817, 4825, "DISEASE"], [5083, 5093, "DISEASE"], [5799, 5806, "DISEASE"], [5967, 5976, "DISEASE"], [247, 257, "DRUG"], [258, 266, "DRUG"], [1094, 1098, "DRUG"], [2300, 2311, "DRUG"], [2315, 2320, "DRUG"], [2357, 2377, "DRUG"], [2450, 2458, "DRUG"], [2712, 2717, "DRUG"], [2921, 2928, "DRUG"], [4951, 4964, "DRUG"], [5549, 5562, "DRUG"], [5701, 5711, "DRUG"], [5718, 5726, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES\n\n1.

Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter.  The umbilical hernia was taken down.  An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin.  A liver retractor was placed to this.\n\nThe colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt.  The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly.  The vena cava was identified.  The main renal vein was identified.  Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided.  Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie.  The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally.  Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided.  Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact.\n\nHemostasis was excellent.\n\nThe umbilical hernia had been completely taken down.  The edges were freshened up.

The abdomen was prepared and draped in usual sterile fashion.  After the induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, supraumbilical incision was made.  A Veress needle was inserted.  Abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg.  A 5-mm port and camera placed.  The abdomen was visually explored.  There were no obvious abnormalities.  A 15-mm port was placed in the suprapubic position in addition of 5 mm was placed in between the 1st two.  Blunt dissection was used to isolate the appendix.  Appendix was separated from surrounding structures.  A window was created between the appendix and the mesoappendix.  GIA stapler was tossed across it and fired.  Mesoappendix was then taken with 2 fires of the vascular load on the GIA stapler.  Appendix was placed in an Endobag and removed from the patient.  Right lower quadrant was copiously irrigated.  All irrigation fluids were removed.  Hemostasis was verified.  The 15-mm port was removed and the port site closed with 0-Vicryl in the Endoclose device.  All other ports were irrigated, infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular sutures.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.

Upon seeing the patient and discussing in extent with the family, it was decided the patient needed to go to the operating room for this nonreducible umbilical hernia and bowel obstruction and the family agreed with surgery.\n\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: \n The patient was found to have an incarcerated umbilical hernia.  There was a loop of small bowel incarcerated within the hernia sac.  It showed signs of ecchymosis, however no signs of any ischemia or necrosis.  It was easily reduced once opening the abdomen and the rest of the small bowel was ran without any other defects or abnormalities.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family.  The patient was brought to the operating suite.  After general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  A midline incision was made around the umbilical hernia defect with a #10 blade scalpel.  Dissection was then carried down to the fascia.  Using a sharp dissection, an incision was made above the defect superior to the defect entering the fascia.  The abdomen was entered under direct visualization.  The small bowel that was entrapped within the hernia sac was easily reduced and observed and appeared to be ecchymotic, however, no signs of ischemia were noted or necrosis.  The remaining of the fascia was then extended using Metzenbaum scissors.  The hernia sac was removed using Mayo scissors and sent off as specimen.  Next, the bowel was run from the ligament of Treitz to the ileocecal valve with no evidence of any other abnormalities.  The small bowel was then milked down removing all the fluid.  The bowel was decompressed distal to the obstruction.  Once returning the abdominal contents to the abdomen, attention was next made in closing the abdomen and using #1 Vicryl suture in the figure-of-eight fashion the fascia was closed.  The umbilicus was then reapproximated to its anatomical position with a #1 Vicryl suture.  A #3-0 Vicryl suture was then used to reapproximate the deep dermal layers and skin staples were used on the skin.  Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[101, 117, "ANATOMY"], [186, 215, "ANATOMY"], [323, 343, "ANATOMY"], [549, 559, "ANATOMY"], [672, 701, "ANATOMY"], [911, 927, "ANATOMY"], [1048, 1077, "ANATOMY"], [1100, 1111, "ANATOMY"], [1136, 1146, "ANATOMY"], [1266, 1273, "ANATOMY"], [1294, 1305, "ANATOMY"], [1343, 1356, "ANATOMY"], [1672, 1688, "ANATOMY"], [1763, 1769, "ANATOMY"], [1872, 1878, "ANATOMY"], [1885, 1892, "ANATOMY"], [1938, 1949, "ANATOMY"], [1980, 1990, "ANATOMY"], [2130, 2136, "ANATOMY"], [2187, 2197, "ANATOMY"], [2267, 2272, "ANATOMY"], [2290, 2308, "ANATOMY"], [2316, 2331, "ANATOMY"], [2362, 2375, "ANATOMY"], [2382, 2393, "ANATOMY"], [2444, 2449, "ANATOMY"], [2514, 2523, "ANATOMY"], [2540, 2547, "ANATOMY"], [2588, 2595, "ANATOMY"], [2616, 2622, "ANATOMY"], [2658, 2664, "ANATOMY"], [2682, 2691, "ANATOMY"], [2723, 2742, "ANATOMY"], [2760, 2766, "ANATOMY"], [2783, 2789, "ANATOMY"], [2837, 2843, "ANATOMY"], [2848, 2852, "ANATOMY"], [2878, 2882, "ANATOMY"], [78, 95, "DISEASE"], [157, 180, "DISEASE"], [284, 307, "DISEASE"], [401, 414, "DISEASE"], [524, 533, "DISEASE"], [703, 734, "DISEASE"], [741, 758, "DISEASE"], [932, 949, "DISEASE"], [1168, 1178, "DISEASE"], [1204, 1212, "DISEASE"], [1615, 1622, "DISEASE"], [2075, 2083, "DISEASE"], [2481, 2492, "DISEASE"], [2885, 2892, "DISEASE"], [3001, 3010, "DISEASE"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Right colon tumor.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.

Extensive fluid was seen upon entering the abdomen, ascites fluid, which was clear straw-colored and this was sampled for cytology.  Next, the small bowel was retracted with digital exploration and there was a evidence of hepatic flexure, colonic mass, which was adherent to the surrounding tissues.  With mobilization of the colon along the line of Toldt down to the right gutter, the entire ileocecal region up to the transverse colon was mobilized into the field.  Next, a window was made 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a GIA-75 was fired across the ileum.  Next, a second GIA device was fired across the proximal transverse colon, just sparring the middle colic artery.  The dissection was then carried down along the mesentry, down to the root of the mesentry.  Several lymph nodes were sampled carefully, and small radiopaque clips were applied along the base of the mesentry.  The mesentry vessels are hemostated and tied with #0-Vicryl suture sequentially, ligated in between.  Once this specimen was submitted to pathology, the wound was inspected.  There was no evidence of bleeding from any of the suture sites.  Next, a side-by-side anastomosis was performed between the transverse colon and the terminal ileum.  A third GIA-75 was fired side-by-side and GIA-55 was used to close the anastomosis.  A patent anastomosis was palpated.  The anastomosis was then protected with a #2-0 Vicryl #0-muscular suture.  Next, the mesenteric root was closed with a running #0-Vicryl suture to prevent any chance of internal hernia.  The suture sites were inspected and there was no evidence of leakage.  Next, the intraabdominal cavity was thoroughly irrigated with sterile saline and the anastomosis was carried into the right lower gutter.  Omentum was used to cover the intestines which appeared dilated and indurated from the near obstruction.  Next, the abdominal wall was reapproximated and the fascial layer using a two running loop PDS sutures meeting in the middle with good approximation of both the abdominal fascia.  Additional sterile saline was used to irrigate the subcutaneous fat and then the skin was closed with sequential sterile staples.\n\nSterile dressing was applied and the skin was cleansed and the patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the Operating Room and she was transferred to Recovery Room in stable condition and will be continued to be monitored on the Telemetry Floor with triple antibiotics and NG decompression.\n\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[69, 80, "ANATOMY"], [120, 131, "ANATOMY"], [561, 576, "ANATOMY"], [1259, 1266, "ANATOMY"], [1389, 1409, "ANATOMY"], [1466, 1482, "ANATOMY"], [1503, 1517, "ANATOMY"], [1542, 1547, "ANATOMY"], [1581, 1595, "ANATOMY"], [1667, 1674, "ANATOMY"], [1767, 1778, "ANATOMY"], [1846, 1861, "ANATOMY"], [1915, 1922, "ANATOMY"], [1950, 1955, "ANATOMY"], [2044, 2060, "ANATOMY"], [2134, 2149, "ANATOMY"], [2184, 2189, "ANATOMY"], [2248, 2264, "ANATOMY"], [2284, 2303, "ANATOMY"], [2406, 2417, "ANATOMY"], [2528, 2535, "ANATOMY"], [2575, 2581, "ANATOMY"], [2740, 2746, "ANATOMY"], [2776, 2787, "ANATOMY"], [2814, 2830, "ANATOMY"], [2839, 2853, "ANATOMY"], [2927, 2938, "ANATOMY"], [2950, 2961, "ANATOMY"], [2981, 2992, "ANATOMY"], [3034, 3042, "ANATOMY"], [3043, 3049, "ANATOMY"], [3062, 3072, "ANATOMY"], [3114, 3120, "ANATOMY"], [3146, 3161, "ANATOMY"], [3168, 3174, "ANATOMY"], [3245, 3259, "ANATOMY"], [3320, 3331, "ANATOMY"], [3374, 3381, "ANATOMY"], [3404, 3414, "ANATOMY"], [3490, 3504, "ANATOMY"], [3532, 3545, "ANATOMY"], [3641, 3657, "ANATOMY"], [3711, 3727, "ANATOMY"], [3741, 3745, "ANATOMY"], [3828, 3832, "ANATOMY"], [75, 86, "DISEASE"], [81, 86, "DISEASE"], [126, 138, "DISEASE"], [132, 138, "DISEASE"], [157, 166, "DISEASE"], [296, 309, "DISEASE"], [680, 694, "DISEASE"], [796, 815, "DISEASE"], [1207, 1215, "DISEASE"], [1303, 1310, "DISEASE"], [1457, 1465, "DISEASE"], [1518, 1524, "DISEASE"], [1863, 1875, "DISEASE"], [2653, 2662, "DISEASE"], [2668, 2673, "DISEASE"], [3225, 3232, "DISEASE"], [3260, 3266, "DISEASE"], [3297, 3304, "DISEASE"], [3466, 3477, "DISEASE"], [3571, 3574, "DISEASE"], [3671, 3678, "DISEASE"], [3773, 3780, "DISEASE"], [3791, 3798, "DISEASE"], [3997, 4006, "DISEASE"], [391, 403, "DRUG"], [1162, 1173, "DRUG"], [3124, 3131, "DRUG"], [4080, 4091, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Refractory dyspepsia.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\n\n1.

She has been on multiple medical regimens and continues with dyspeptic symptoms.\n\n\nPROCEDURE: \n After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation achieved, the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and the esophagus was easily intubated.  At the GE junction, a hiatal hernia was present.  There were mild inflammatory changes consistent with reflux esophagitis.  The scope was then passed into the stomach.  It was insufflated and the scope was coursed along the greater curvature to the antrum.  The pylorus was patent.  There was evidence of bile reflux in the antrum.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined and were without evidence of mass, ulceration, or inflammation.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum.\n\nA retroflexion was attempted multiple times, however, the patient was having difficulty holding the air and adequate retroflexion view was not visualized.  The gastroscope was then slowly withdrawn.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the fundus or body.  Once again at the GE junction, esophageal biopsy was taken.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will return to the General Medical Floor.  We will continue b.i.d proton-pump inhibitor therapy as well as dietary restrictions.  She should also attempt significant weight loss.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[123, 136, "ANATOMY"], [927, 938, "ANATOMY"], [947, 956, "ANATOMY"], [987, 989, "ANATOMY"], [1002, 1015, "ANATOMY"], [1139, 1146, "ANATOMY"], [1204, 1221, "ANATOMY"], [1229, 1235, "ANATOMY"], [1242, 1249, "ANATOMY"], [1304, 1310, "ANATOMY"], [1317, 1330, "ANATOMY"], [1461, 1467, "ANATOMY"], [1472, 1484, "ANATOMY"], [1587, 1599, "ANATOMY"], [1690, 1703, "ANATOMY"], [1717, 1723, "ANATOMY"], [1727, 1731, "ANATOMY"], [1752, 1754, "ANATOMY"], [80, 89, "DISEASE"], [142, 160, "DISEASE"], [344, 357, "DISEASE"], [425, 430, "DISEASE"], [470, 476, "DISEASE"], [481, 485, "DISEASE"], [491, 499, "DISEASE"], [510, 523, "DISEASE"], [532, 542, "DISEASE"], [547, 560, "DISEASE"], [634, 642, "DISEASE"], [1083, 1101, "DISEASE"], [1285, 1296, "DISEASE"], [1390, 1400, "DISEASE"], [1405, 1417, "DISEASE"], [1924, 1933, "DISEASE"], [219, 225, "DRUG"], [289, 296, "DRUG"], [301, 307, "DRUG"], [813, 820, "DRUG"], [825, 831, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: \n Blood loss anemia.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:\n\n1.

She underwent an EGD and attempted colonoscopy; however, due to a very poor prep, only a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed at that time.  A coloscopy is now being performed for completion.\n\n\nPROCEDURE:\n  After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Endoscopy Suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given sedation by the Anesthesia Department.  A digital rectal exam was performed and there was no evidence of mass.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the rectum.  There was some solid stool encountered.  The scope was maneuvered around this.  There was relatively poor prep as the scope was advanced through the sigmoid colon and portions of the descending colon.  The scope was then passed through the transverse colon and ascending colon to the cecum.  No masses or polyps were noted.  Visualization of the portions of the colon was however somewhat limited.  There were scattered diverticuli noted in the sigmoid.\n\nThe scope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed and nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids were noted.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will be placed on a high-fiber diet and Colace and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[961, 967, "ANATOMY"], [1119, 1132, "ANATOMY"], [1153, 1169, "ANATOMY"], [1210, 1226, "ANATOMY"], [1231, 1246, "ANATOMY"], [1254, 1259, "ANATOMY"], [1275, 1281, "ANATOMY"], [1332, 1337, "ANATOMY"], [1415, 1422, "ANATOMY"], [1500, 1506, "ANATOMY"], [69, 86, "DISEASE"], [145, 165, "DISEASE"], [428, 445, "DISEASE"], [1550, 1570, "DISEASE"], [1714, 1723, "DISEASE"], [1770, 1776, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nREASON FOR CONSULTATION: \n I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\n  The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007.  At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy.  Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks.  She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007.  She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y.  Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.\n\nOn colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure.  She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion.  Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.\n\nShe had surgical resection done yesterday.  The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis.  At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.\n\nPathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis.  There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted.  Radial margin was 0.1 mm.  Other margins were 5 and 6 mm.  Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.\n\nStaging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs.  The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1.  The ovaries were normal.  An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.\n\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\n  She has otherwise been feeling well.  She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy.  She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber.  She was eating well up until the time of her surgery.  She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June.  She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.\n\n\nALLERGIES: \n PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:\n  None.\n\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: \n No significant medical problem.  She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks.  She has no prior surgeries.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  \nShe smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s.  A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week.  She does not smoke now.  She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine.  She is married and has no children.  An IUD was recently placed.  She works as an esthetician.\n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  \nFather died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45.  This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history.  She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early.  Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44.  Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago.  Otherwise, he has no medical problem.  Mother is aged 82 and healthy.  She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: \n \nGENERAL:  She is in no acute distress.\nVITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.\nSKIN:  Warm and dry.  She has no jaundice.\nLYMPHATICS:  No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable.\nLUNGS:  There is no respiratory distress.\nCARDIAC:  Regular rate.\nABDOMEN:  Soft and mildly tender.  Dressings are clean and dry.\nEXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema is noted.  Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place.\n\n\nLABORATORY DATA:\n  White blood count of 11.7, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 408, differential shows left shift, MCV is 99.6.  Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133.  Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.\n\n\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN: \n Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1.  She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled.  Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.\n\nA lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.  Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy.  I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age.  Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.\n\nPlan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects.  We did not review all that information today.\n\nShe has a family history of early colon cancer.  Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can.  Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available.  She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy.  She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission.  I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed.  If not, those can be drawn tomorrow.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[680, 686, "ANATOMY"], [783, 798, "ANATOMY"], [1042, 1053, "ANATOMY"], [1080, 1091, "ANATOMY"], [1232, 1238, "ANATOMY"], [1261, 1272, "ANATOMY"], [1518, 1544, "ANATOMY"], [1573, 1588, "ANATOMY"], [1665, 1670, "ANATOMY"], [1681, 1687, "ANATOMY"], [1729, 1731, "ANATOMY"], [1741, 1748, "ANATOMY"], [1811, 1817, "ANATOMY"], [2013, 2018, "ANATOMY"], [2215, 2224, "ANATOMY"], [2226, 2233, "ANATOMY"], [2235, 2240, "ANATOMY"], [2242, 2249, "ANATOMY"], [2251, 2258, "ANATOMY"], [2629, 2632, "ANATOMY"], [3208, 3214, "ANATOMY"], [3584, 3589, "ANATOMY"], [3590, 3597, "ANATOMY"], [3599, 3603, "ANATOMY"], [3642, 3652, "ANATOMY"], [3658, 3666, "ANATOMY"], [3670, 3697, "ANATOMY"], [3712, 3717, "ANATOMY"], [3754, 3761, "ANATOMY"], [3778, 3785, "ANATOMY"], [3842, 3853, "ANATOMY"], [3966, 3971, "ANATOMY"], [4436, 4447, "ANATOMY"], [4563, 4568, "ANATOMY"], [5778, 5783, "ANATOMY"], [5883, 5888, "ANATOMY"], [149, 161, "DISEASE"], [261, 279, "DISEASE"], [352, 360, "DISEASE"], [423, 434, "DISEASE"], [472, 490, "DISEASE"], [619, 632, "DISEASE"], [862, 871, "DISEASE"], [881, 893, "DISEASE"], [1108, 1117, "DISEASE"], [1125, 1145, "DISEASE"], [1291, 1301, "DISEASE"], [1420, 1446, "DISEASE"], [1644, 1663, "DISEASE"], [1694, 1706, "DISEASE"], [1904, 1916, "DISEASE"], [1963, 1968, "DISEASE"], [1970, 1989, "DISEASE"], [1991, 2000, "DISEASE"], [2002, 2011, "DISEASE"], [2033, 2039, "DISEASE"], [2044, 2067, "DISEASE"], [2263, 2299, "DISEASE"], [2303, 2312, "DISEASE"], [2341, 2346, "DISEASE"], [2488, 2500, "DISEASE"], [2908, 2929, "DISEASE"], [3142, 3157, "DISEASE"], [3357, 3372, "DISEASE"], [3632, 3640, "DISEASE"], [3732, 3752, "DISEASE"], [3919, 3923, "DISEASE"], [4234, 4238, "DISEASE"], [4258, 4279, "DISEASE"], [4306, 4318, "DISEASE"], [4477, 4482, "DISEASE"], [4524, 4532, "DISEASE"], [4929, 4939, "DISEASE"], [4954, 4981, "DISEASE"], [4983, 4986, "DISEASE"], [5441, 5453, "DISEASE"], [5573, 5578, "DISEASE"], [5599, 5625, "DISEASE"], [2316, 2326, "DRUG"], [2371, 2382, "DRUG"], [3574, 3580, "DRUG"], [4081, 4087, "DRUG"], [4096, 4105, "DRUG"], [4111, 4117, "DRUG"], [4163, 4170, "DRUG"], [4180, 4187, "DRUG"], [4988, 4996, "DRUG"], [5090, 5094, "DRUG"], [5399, 5404, "DRUG"], [5900, 5907, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nCHIEF COMPLAINT:\n  GI bleed.\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\n  The patient is an 80-year-old white female with history of atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, who presented as outpatient, complaining of increasing fatigue.

Prostate was normal in size and consistency.\n\nThe colonoscope was inserted into the rectal ampulla and advanced under direct vision at all times until the tip of the scope was placed in the cecum.  The position of the scope within the cecum was verified by identification of the ileocecal valve.  Navigation was difficult because it seemed that the cecum took an upward turn at its final turn, but the examination was completed.\n\nThe cecum was extensively studied and no lesion was seen.  There was not even a scar representing the prior polyp.  I was able to see the area across from the ileocecal valve exactly where the polyp was two years ago, and I saw no lesion at all.  The scope was then slowly withdrawn.  In the mid transverse colon, was a small submucosal lesion, which appeared to be a lipoma.  It was freely mobile and very small with normal overlying mucosa.  There was a similar lesion in the descending colon.  Both of these appeared to be lipomatous, so no attempt was made to remove them.  There were diverticula present in the sigmoid colon.  In addition, there were two polyps in the sigmoid colon both of which were resected using electrocautery.  There was no bleeding.  The scope was then withdrawn.  The rectum was normal.  When the scope was retroflexed in the rectum, two very small polyps were noted just at the anorectal margin, and so these were obliterated using the electrocautery snare.  There was no specimen and there was no bleeding.  The scope was then straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.\n\n\nENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:\n\n1.  Small polyps, sigmoid colon, resected them.\n2.  Diverticulosis, sigmoid colon.\n3.  Small rectal polyps, obliterated them.\n4.  Submucosal lesions, consistent with lipomata as described.\n5.

I asked the nurse to give her 25 mg of Demerol IV.\n\nFollowing the IV Demerol, she had a nausea reaction.  She was then given 25 mg of Phenergan IV.  Following this, her headache and nausea completely resolved.  She was then given a total of 7.5 mg of Versed with adequate sedation.  Rectal exam revealed no external lesions.  Digital exam revealed no mass.\n\n\nREPORTED PROCEDURE:\n  The P160 colonoscope was used.  The scope was placed in the rectal ampulla and advanced to the cecum.  Navigation through the sigmoid colon was difficult.  Beginning at 30 cm was a very tight bend.  With gentle maneuvering, the scope passed through and then entered the cecum.  The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending colon were normal.  The sigmoid colon was likewise normal.  There were five very small (punctate) polyps in the rectum.  One was resected using the electrocautery snare and the other four were ablated using the snare and cautery.  There was no specimen because the polyps were so small.  The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no further abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated.\n\n\nENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION:\n\n1.

Gallbladder.\n2. Lymph node.\n\n\nDRAINS:\n One 19-French round Blake.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION:\n After consent was obtained and the patient was properly identified, the patient was transported to the operating room and after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.\n\nAfter infiltration with local, a vertical incision was made at the umbilicus and utilizing graspers, the underlying fascia was incised and was divided sharply. Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open.\n\nThe trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it. After it was divided, the gallbladder was freed from the field.\n\nOnce this was done, the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery. Copious irrigation was also used. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in Morrison's pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2-0 nylon; this was a 19-French round Blake. Once this was done, the umbilical port was closed with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The skin was closed with and absorbable stitch.\n\nThe patient was then awakened from anesthesia, extubated, and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[441, 452, "ANATOMY"], [457, 467, "ANATOMY"], [846, 855, "ANATOMY"], [895, 901, "ANATOMY"], [963, 980, "ANATOMY"], [1061, 1068, "ANATOMY"], [1134, 1141, "ANATOMY"], [1168, 1175, "ANATOMY"], [1190, 1206, "ANATOMY"], [1385, 1392, "ANATOMY"], [1431, 1450, "ANATOMY"], [1618, 1625, "ANATOMY"], [1723, 1730, "ANATOMY"], [1754, 1765, "ANATOMY"], [1795, 1802, "ANATOMY"], [2090, 2097, "ANATOMY"], [2102, 2108, "ANATOMY"], [2213, 2235, "ANATOMY"], [2290, 2297, "ANATOMY"], [2317, 2328, "ANATOMY"], [2455, 2466, "ANATOMY"], [2476, 2493, "ANATOMY"], [2521, 2533, "ANATOMY"], [2568, 2581, "ANATOMY"], [2692, 2699, "ANATOMY"], [2708, 2719, "ANATOMY"], [2842, 2853, "ANATOMY"], [2905, 2910, "ANATOMY"], [3091, 3108, "ANATOMY"], [3208, 3217, "ANATOMY"], [3312, 3318, "ANATOMY"], [3365, 3369, "ANATOMY"], [67, 69, "DISEASE"], [76, 90, "DISEASE"], [95, 108, "DISEASE"], [137, 139, "DISEASE"], [163, 187, "DISEASE"], [192, 206, "DISEASE"], [360, 373, "DISEASE"], [761, 768, "DISEASE"], [1176, 1185, "DISEASE"], [2683, 2691, "DISEASE"], [3288, 3293, "DISEASE"], [3515, 3524, "DISEASE"], [1292, 1296, "DRUG"], [3021, 3025, "DRUG"], [3159, 3163, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nPROCEDURE:\n Upper endoscopy with foreign body removal.\n\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):\n Esophageal foreign body.\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES):\n Penny in proximal esophagus.\n\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:\n None.\n\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\n None.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: \nAfter informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the pediatric endoscopy suite. After appropriate sedation by the anesthesia staff and intubation, an upper endoscope was inserted into the mouth, over the tongue, into the esophagus, at which time the foreign body was encountered. It was grasped with a coin removal forcep and removed with an endoscope. At that time, the endoscope was reinserted, advanced to the level of the stomach and stomach was evaluated and was normal. The esophagus was normal with the exception of some mild erythema, where the coin had been sitting. There were no erosions. The stomach was decompressed of air and fluid.

Colonoscopy during that admission showed internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis, but a bleeding site was not identified. Five days after discharge to a nursing home, she again experienced bloody bowel movements and returned to the emergency department for evaluation. \n\n\nREVIEW OF SYMPTOMS: \nNo chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain or cramping, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness. Positive for generalized weakness and diarrhea the day of admission. \n\n\nPRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:\n Long-standing hypertension, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and hypercholesterolemia. Renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell bladder cancer status post left nephrectomy, radical cystectomy, and ileal loop diversion 6 weeks prior to presentation, postoperative course complicated by pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and retroperitoneal bleed. Deep venous thrombosis 2 weeks prior to presentation, management complicated by lower gastrointestinal bleeding, status post inferior vena cava filter placement. \n\n\nMEDICATIONS: \nDiltiazem 30 mg tid, pantoprazole 40 mg qd, epoetin alfa 40,000 units weekly, iron 325 mg bid, cholestyramine. Warfarin discontinued approximately 10 days earlier. \n\n\nALLERGIES: \nCelecoxib (rash).\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\n Resided at nursing home. Denied alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. \n\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:\n Non-contributory.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: \n\nTemp = 38.3C BP =146/52 HR= 113 RR = 18 SaO2 = 98% room air \nGeneral: Pale, ill-appearing elderly female. \nHEENT: Pale conjunctivae, oral mucous membranes moist. \nCVS: Irregularly irregular, tachycardia. \nLungs: Decreased breath sounds at the bases. \nAbdomen: Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, gross blood on rectal exam. \nExtremities: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. \nSkin: Warm, normal turgor. \nNeuro: Alert and oriented.

Emergency department personnel made several attempts to place a nasogastric tube for gastric lavage, but were unsuccessful. During her evaluation, the patient was noted to desaturate to 80% on room air, with an increase in her respiratory rate to 34 breaths per minute. She was administered 50% oxygen by nonrebreadier mask, with improvement in her oxygen saturation to 89%. Computed tomographic angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism. \n\nThe patient was admitted to the medicine service for further workup and management of gastrointestinal bleeding and hypoxia. She was alert, awake, and hemodynamically stable, but remained tachypneic and hypoxic despite high-flow oxygen. She continued to perseverate on the fact that she had been unable to swallow the nasogastric tube earlier in the evening &amp;quot;even with that banana spray&amp;quot; (topical benzocaine 20%). While obtaining a sample for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, the medical team noted that the blood was abnormally dark. The sample was sent for co-oximetry as well, which revealed a methemoglobin level of 15.2%. ABG showed a pH of 7.41, PCO2 31 mmHg, PO2 374 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. \nThe patient was treated with methylene blue, with rapid resolution of tachypnea and improvement of oxygen saturation to 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula.\r\n        \n\n\r\n        \r\n", {"entities": [[189, 194, "ANATOMY"], [245, 266, "ANATOMY"], [540, 545, "ANATOMY"], [1028, 1038, "ANATOMY"], [1304, 1322, "ANATOMY"], [1802, 1807, "ANATOMY"], [1828, 1832, "ANATOMY"], [1833, 1849, "ANATOMY"], [1900, 1905, "ANATOMY"], [1946, 1953, "ANATOMY"], [2015, 2020, "ANATOMY"], [2038, 2049, "ANATOMY"], [2085, 2089, "ANATOMY"], [2643, 2649, "ANATOMY"], [3655, 3660, "ANATOMY"], [3994, 3999, "ANATOMY"], [4000, 4007, "ANATOMY"], [199, 213, "DISEASE"], [215, 237, "DISEASE"], [311, 342, "DISEASE"], [385, 405, "DISEASE"], [432, 440, "DISEASE"], [626, 634, "DISEASE"], [640, 650, "DISEASE"], [666, 680, "DISEASE"], [684, 692, "DISEASE"], [694, 700, "DISEASE"], [702, 710, "DISEASE"], [715, 730, "DISEASE"], [745, 765, "DISEASE"], [770, 778, "DISEASE"], [842, 854, "DISEASE"], [856, 888, "DISEASE"], [894, 914, "DISEASE"], [916, 936, "DISEASE"], [941, 973, "DISEASE"], [1116, 1125, "DISEASE"], [1127, 1150, "DISEASE"], [1179, 1201, "DISEASE"], [1259, 1290, "DISEASE"], [1525, 1534, "DISEASE"], [1548, 1552, "DISEASE"], [1765, 1769, "DISEASE"], [1771, 1774, "DISEASE"], [1809, 1813, "DISEASE"], [2054, 2062, "DISEASE"], [2064, 2072, "DISEASE"], [2077, 2082, "DISEASE"], [3105, 3123, "DISEASE"], [3213, 3238, "DISEASE"], [3243, 3250, "DISEASE"], [3330, 3337, "DISEASE"], [3914, 3924, "DISEASE"], [1344, 1355, "DRUG"], [1358, 1367, "DRUG"], [1379, 1397, "DRUG"], [1402, 1414, "DRUG"], [1436, 1440, "DRUG"], [1453, 1467, "DRUG"], [1469, 1477, "DRUG"], [1537, 1546, "DRUG"], [1606, 1613, "DRUG"], [1615, 1622, "DRUG"], [2293, 2295, "DRUG"], [2318, 2324, "DRUG"], [2338, 2347, "DRUG"], [2382, 2393, "DRUG"], [2444, 2451, "DRUG"], [2573, 2586, "DRUG"], [2591, 2600, "DRUG"], [2975, 2981, "DRUG"], [3159, 3167, "DRUG"], [3356, 3362, "DRUG"], [3510, 3516, "DRUG"], [3534, 3552, "DRUG"], [3887, 3901, "DRUG"]]}], ["\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \nEXAM: \n Ultrasound abdomen, complete.\n\n\nHISTORY: \n 38-year-old male admitted from the emergency room 04/18/2009, decreased mental status and right upper lobe pneumonia.
