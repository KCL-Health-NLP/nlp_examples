        "* the encoder layer of an encoder-decoder\n",

        "###Prompting\n",
        "These models generate text. You can play with them, asking them to write songs, poems etc etc, typing text at a **prompt**, with the model completing the text you have started by generating the next N words. What you get depends partly on the model, partly on model parameters you set, but also partly on the way in which you ask the question - i.e. your **prompt engineering**.\n",

So, we will use a [remotely hosted model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/dedicated). Hugging Face has several publically availabel models. For Llama 3, we are using a paid-for model hosting service. This gives us more control over availability, scaling etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "All models have different ways of interacting with them, whether via a prompt or an API. We will be using a widely-used Python library that hides these differences behind a common API, [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). LangChain will work with many different models, both remotely hosted and locally hosted. So you should be able to re-purpose this code for other models and situations.\n",
