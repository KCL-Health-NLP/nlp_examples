        "* the encoder layer of an encoder-decoder\n",

        "These models generate text. You can play with them, asking them to write songs, poems etc etc, typing text at a **prompt**, with the model completing the text you have started by generating the next N words. What you get depends partly on the model, partly on model parameters you set, but also partly on the way in which you ask the question - i.e. your **prompt engineering**.\n",

        "These models are large! You could put them on your laptop, but (a) they will take time to download and (b) they might dwarf it's memory. So, we will use a remotely hosted model, on Hugging Face. Hugging Face has several publically availabel models. For Llama 3, we are using a paid-for model hosting service. This gives us more control over availability, scaling etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "All models have different ways of interacting with them, whether via a prompt or an API. We will be using a widely-used Python library that hides these differences behind a common API, LangChain. LangChain will work with many different models, both remotely hosted and locally hosted. So you should be able to re-purpose this code for other models and situations.\n",
