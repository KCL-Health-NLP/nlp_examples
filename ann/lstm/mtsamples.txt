gPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Syncopal episodes with injury.  See electrophysiology consultation.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Normal electrophysiologic studies.
2.  No inducible arrhythmia.
3.  Procainamide infusion negative for Brugada syndrome.

PROCEDURES:

1.  Comprehensive electrophysiology studies with attempted arrhythmia induction.
2.  IV Procainamide infusion for Brugada syndrome.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
 The patient gave informed consent for comprehensive electrophysiologic studies.  She received small amounts of intravenous fentanyl and Versed for conscious sedation.  Then 1% lidocaine local anesthesia was used.  Three catheters were placed via the right femoral vein; 5-French catheters to the right ventricular apex and right atrial appendage; and a 6-French catheter to the His bundle.  Later in the procedure, the RV apical catheter was moved to RV outflow tract.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL FINDINGS:
  Conduction intervals in sinus rhythm were normal.  Sinus cycle length 768 ms, PA interval 24 ms, AH interval 150 ms, HV interval 46 ms.  Sinus node recovery times were also normal at 1114 ms.  Corrected sinus node recovery time was normal at 330 ms.  One-to-one AV conduction was present to cycle length 480 ms, AH interval 240 ms, HV interval 54 ms.  AV nodal effective refractory period was normal, 440 ms at drive cycle length 600 ms.  RA-ERP was 250 ms.  With ventricular pacing, there was VA disassociation present.

Since there was no evidence for dual AV nodal pathways, and poor retrograde conduction, isoproterenol infusion was not performed to look for SVT.

Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed at both right ventricular apex and right ventricular outflow tracts.  Drive cycle length 600, 500, and 400 ms was used with triple extrastimuli down to troubling intervals of 180 ms, or refractoriness.  There was no inducible VT.  Longest run was 5 beats of polymorphic VT, which is a nonspecific finding.  From the apex 400-600 with 2 extrastimuli were delivered, again with no inducible VT.

Procainamide was then infused, 20 mg/kg over 10 minutes.  There were no ST segment changes.  HV interval after IV Procainamide remained normal at 50 ms.

ASSESSMENT: 
 Normal electrophysiologic studies.  No evidence for sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block.  No inducible supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia, and no evidence for Brugada syndrome.

PLAN: 
 The patient will follow up with Dr. X.  She recently had an ambulatory EEG.  I will plan to see her again on a p.r.n. basis should she develop a recurrent syncopal episodes.  Reveal event monitor was considered, but not placed since she has only had one single episode.

This 65 y/o RHM reportedly suffered a stroke on 1/17/92. He presented locally at that time with complaint of episodic confusion and memory loss lasting several minutes per episode. The &quot;stroke&quot; was reportedly verified on MRI scan dated 1/17/92. He was subsequently placed on ASA and DPH. He admitted that there had been short periods (1-2 days duration) since then, during which he had forgotten to take his DPH. However, even when he had been taking his DPH regularly, he continued to experience the spells mentioned above. He denied any associated tonic/clonic movement, incontinence, tongue-biting, HA, visual change, SOB, palpitation, weakness or numbness. The episodes of confusion and memory loss last 1-2 minutes in duration, and have been occurring 2-3 times per week.

ANESTHESIA:  
IV Sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:

COMPLICATIONS:
  None.

INDICATIONS: 
 Patient with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, left side.  Positive for allodynia, pain, mottled appearance, skin changes upper extremities as well as swelling.

SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: 
 Patient is admitted to the Operating Room.  Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  

Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.  Four lesions were carried out.

EXAM:
MRI OF THE RIGHT ANKLE

CLINICAL:
Pain.

FINDINGS:

The bone marrow demonstrates normal signal intensity. There is no evidence of bone contusion or fracture. There is no evidence of joint effusion. Tendinous structures surrounding the ankle joint are intact. No abnormal mass or fluid collection is seen surrounding the ankle joint.

IMPRESSION
: NORMAL MRI OF THE RIGHT ANKLE.

DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Chest discomfort, evaluation for coronary artery disease.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
 The patient was brought to the cardiac center.  Cardiac images at rest were obtained in the parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two views followed by starting with a dobutamine drip in the usual fashion at 10 mcg/kg per minute for low dose, increased every 2 to 3 minutes by 10 mcg/kg per minute.  The patient maximized at 30 mcg/kg per minute.  Images were obtained at that level after adding 0.7 mg of atropine to reach maximal heart rate of 145.  Maximal images were obtained in the same windows of parasternal long and short axis, apical four and apical two windows.

Wall motion assessed at all levels as well as at recovery.

The patient got nauseated, had some mild shortness of breath.  No angina during the procedure and the maximal amount of dobutamine was 30 mcg/kg per minute.

The resting heart rate was 78 with the resting blood pressure 186/98.  Heart rate reduced by the vasodilator effects of dobutamine to 130/80.  Maximal heart rate achieved was 145, which is 85% of age-predicted heart rate.

The EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no ST-T wave depression suggestive of ischemia or injury.  Incomplete right bundle-branch block was seen.  The maximal stress test EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  There was subtle upsloping ST depression in III and aVF, which is a normal response to the tachycardia with dobutamine, but no significant depression suggestive of ischemia and no ST elevation seen.

No ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ectopy seen during the test.  The heart rate recovered in a normal fashion after using metoprolol 5 mg.

The heart images were somewhat suboptimal to evaluate because of obesity and some problems with the short axis windows mainly at peak exercise.

The EF at rest appeared to be normal at 55 to 60 with normal wall motion including anterior, anteroseptal, inferior, lateral, and septal walls at low dose.  All walls mentioned were augmented in a normal fashion.  At maximum dose, all walls were augmented on all views except for the short axis was foreshortened, was uncertain about the anterolateral wall at peak exercise; however, of the other views, the lateral wall was showing normal thickening and normal augmentation.  EF improved to about 70%.

The wall motion score was unchanged.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Maximal dobutamine stress echocardiogram test achieving more than 85% of age-predicted heart rate.
2.  Negative EKG criteria for ischemia.
3.  Normal augmentation at low and maximum stress test with some uncertainty about the anterolateral wall in peak exercise only on the short axis view.  This is considered the negative dobutamine stress echocardiogram test, medical management.

C3-4: There is disc desiccation with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type. The small posterior central disc protrusion measures 3 x 6mm (AP x transverse) in size and is producing ventral thecal sac flattening. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures 9mm. There is minimal right-sided uncovertebral joint arthrosis but no substantial foraminal compromise.

C4-5: There is disc desiccation, slight loss of disc space height with a right posterior lateral pre-foraminal disc osteophyte complex with right-sided uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis. The disc osteophyte complex measures approximately 5mm in its AP dimension. There is minimal posterior annular bulging measuring approximately 2mm. The AP diameter of the central canal has been narrowed to 9mm. CSF remains present surrounding the cord. There is probable radicular impingement upon the exiting right C5 nerve root.

C5-6: There is disc desiccation, moderate loss of disc space height with a posterior central disc herniation of the protrusion type. The disc protrusion measures approximately 3 x 8mm (AP x transverse) in size. There is ventral thecal sac flattening with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft. The residual AP diameter of the central canal has been narrowed to 7mm. Findings indicate a loss of the functional reserve of the central canal but there is no cord edema. There is bilateral uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis with moderate foraminal compromise.

C6-7: There is disc desiccation, mild loss of disc space height with 2mm of posterior annular bulging. There is bilateral uncovertebral and apophyseal joint arthrosis (left greater than right) with probable radicular impingement upon the bilateral exiting C7 nerve roots.

C7-T1, T1-2: There is disc desiccation with no disc displacement. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina.

C6-7 degenerative disc disease with annular bulging and osseous foraminal compromise with probable impingement upon the bilateral exiting C7 nerve roots.

T3-4 degenerative disc disease with posterior annular bulging.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Acute cholecystitis.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Acute gangrenous cholecystitis with cholelithiasis.

OPERATION PERFORMED: 
 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram.

FINDINGS:  
The patient had essentially a dead gallbladder with stones and positive wide bile/pus coming from the gallbladder.

COMPLICATIONS:  
None.

EBL: 
 Scant.

SPECIMEN REMOVED: 
 Gallbladder with stones.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  
The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion under general anesthesia.  A curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus.  Through this incision, the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization.  Once this complete, insufflation was begun.  Once insufflation was adequate, additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant.  Once all four ports were placed, the right upper quadrant was then explored.  The patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis.  This was taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder.  The gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall.  Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area.  Once the adhesions were fully removed, the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction.  At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed.  The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected.  The gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder.  Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery was achieved.  The gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port.  A JP drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture.  Next, the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator.  Once this was complete, the additional ports were able to be removed.  The fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion.  All skin incisions were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain.  The skin was reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
        This is a 27-year-old female with a size and date discrepancy.

INTERPRETATION: 
 MRI of the cervical spine without contrast showed normal vertebral body height and alignment with normal cervical cord signal.  At C4-C5, there were minimal uncovertebral osteophytes with mild associated right foraminal compromise.  At C5-C6, there were minimal diffuse disc bulge and uncovertebral osteophytes with indentation of the anterior thecal sac, but no cord deformity or foraminal compromise.  At C6-C7, there was a central disc herniation resulting in mild deformity of the anterior aspect of the cord with patent neuroforamina.  MRI of the thoracic spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment.  There was evidence of disc generation, especially anteriorly at the T5-T6 level.  There was no significant central canal or foraminal compromise.  Thoracic cord normal in signal morphology.  MRI of the lumbar spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment.  There is disc desiccation at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with no significant central canal or foraminal stenosis at L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4.  There was a right paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 narrowing of the right lateral recess.  The transversing nerve root on the right was impinged at that level.  The right foramen was mildly compromised.  There was also a central disc protrusion seen at the L5-S1 level resulting in indentation of the anterior thecal sac and minimal bilateral foraminal compromise.

IMPRESSION: 
 Overall impression was mild degenerative changes present in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine without high-grade central canal or foraminal narrowing.  There was narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 level and associated impingement of the transversing nerve root at that level by a disc protrusion.  This was also seen on a prior study.

VITAL SIGNS: 
 See nurse's notes.

COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.

DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: 
 INT was placed.  The patient was in the operating room in the prone position.  The back prepped with Betadine.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Under fluoroscopy, the right sacral alar notch was identified.  After placement of a 20-gauge, 10 cm SMK needle into the notch, a positive sensory, negative motor stimulation was obtained.  Following negative aspiration, 5 cc of 0.5% of Marcaine and 20 mg of Depo-Medrol were injected.  Coagulation was then carried out at 90oC for 90 seconds.  The SMK needle was then moved to the mid-inferior third of the right sacroiliac joint.  Again the steps dictated above were repeated.

The above was repeated for the posterior primary ramus branch right at S2 and S3 by stimulating along the superior lateral wall of the foramen; then followed by steroid injected and coagulation as above.

There were no complications.  The patient was returned to outpatient recovery in stable condition.

CC:
 HA and vision loss.

HX: 
71 y/o RHM developed a cataclysmic headache on 11/5/92 associated with a violent sneeze. The headache lasted 3-4 days. On 11/7/92, he had acute pain and loss of vision in the left eye. Over the following day his left pupil enlarged and his left upper eyelid began to droop. He was seen locally and a brain CT showed no sign of bleeding, but a tortuous left middle cerebral artery was visualized. The patient was transferred to UIHC 11/12/92.

FHX:
 HTN, stroke, coronary artery disease, melanoma.

SHX:

PMH: 
CHF, Atrial Fibrillation, Obesity, Anemia, Duodenal Ulcer, Spinal AVM resection 1986 with residual T9 sensory level, hyperreflexia and bilateral babinski signs, COPD.

EXAM: 
35.5C, BP 140/91, P86, RR20. Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. CN: No light perception OS, Pupils: 3/7 decreasing to 2/7 on exposure to light (i.e., fixed/dilated pupil OS). Upon neutral gaze the left eye deviated laterally and inferiorly. There was complete ptosis OS. On downward gaze their was intorsion OS. The left eye could not move superiorly, medially or effectively downward, but could move laterally. EOM were full OD. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor, Coordination, Station and Gait testing were unremarkable. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick and light touch below T9 (old). Muscle stretch reflexes were increased (3+/3+) in both lower extremities and there were bilateral babinski signs (old). The upper extremity reflexes were symmetrical (2/2). Cardiovascular exam revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm and lung sounds were coarse bilaterally. The rest of the general exam was unremarkable.

LAB:
 CBC, PT/PTT, General Screen were unremarkable except for a BUN 21mg/DL. CSF: protein 88mg/DL, glucose 58mg/DL, RBC 2800/mm3, WBC 1/mm3. ANA, RF, TSH, FT4 were WNL.

IMPRESSION:
 CN3 palsy and loss of vision. Differential diagnosis: temporal arteritis, aneurysm, intracranial mass.

COURSE:
 The outside Brain CT revealed a tortuous left MCA. A four-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed a dolichoectatic basilar artery and tortuous LICA. There was no evidence of aneursym. Transesophageal Echocardiogram revealed atrial enlargement only. Neuroopthalmologic evaluation revealed: Loss of color vision and visual acuity OS, RAPD OS, bilateral optic disk pallor (OS &gt; OD), CN3 palsy and bilateral temporal field loss, OS &gt;&gt; OD . ESR, CRP, MRI were recommended to rule out temporal arteritis and intracranial mass. ESR 29mm/Hr, CRP 4.3mg/DL (high) , The patient was placed on prednisone. Temporal artery biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis. MRI scan could not be obtained due to patient weight. Sellar CT was done instead: coronal sections revealed sellar enlargement and upward bowing of the diaphragm sella suggesting a pituitary mass. In retrospect sellar enlargement could be seen on the angiogram X-rays. Differential consideration was given to cystic pituitary adenoma, noncalcified craniopharyngioma, or Rathke's cleft cyst with solid component. The patient refused surgery. He was seen in Neuroopthalmology Clinic 2/18/93 and was found to have mild recovery of vision OS and improved visual fields. Aberrant reinnervation of the 3rd nerve was noted as there was constriction of the pupil (OS) on adduction, downgaze and upgaze. The upper eyelid, OS, elevated on adduction and down gaze, OS. EOM movements were otherwise full and there was no evidence of ptosis. In retrospect he was felt to have suffered pituitary apoplexy in 11/92.
        HISTORY:  The patient is a 51-year-old status post C3-C4 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion in 1986 and again in 1994.  She had excellent response to those surgeries.  She was pain free until about a year ago when she started noticing pain in her neck, both shoulders, and down her right arm.  Around the same time she also noticed low back pain radiating down the posterior aspect of the right leg into her right foot.  She noticed weakness in the right hand especially with opening bottles, etc.  The weakness has improved somewhat.  She feels that her pain is worsening.  She denies any left arm or leg symptoms.  No change in bladder function.  Over the last year she states that she has undergone physical therapy as well as steroid injections in her neck, but these were not effective.  She states her right upper extremity symptoms are more severe than the lower extremity symptoms.

She has an extensive past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and irritable bowel syndrome.  She has also had bilateral carpal tunnel release.

On examination, normal range of movement of C-spine.  She has full strength in upper and lower extremities.  Normal straight leg raising.  Reflexes are 2 and symmetric throughout.  No Babinski.  She has numbness to light touch in her right big toe.

NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:  The right median palmar sensory distal latencies are minimally prolonged with minimally attenuated evoked response amplitude.  Bilateral tibial motor nerves could not be obtained (technical).  The remaining nerves tested revealed normal distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, F-waves, and H. reflexes.

NEEDLE EMG:  Needle EMG was performed on the right arm and leg and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles and the left FDI.  It revealed 2+ spontaneous activity in the right APB and FDI and 1+ spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, lower and middle lumbosacral paraspinals, right extensor digitorum communis muscle, and right pronator teres.  There was evidence of chronic denervation in the right first dorsal interosseous, pronator teres, abductor pollicis brevis, and left first dorsal interosseous.

IMPRESSION:  This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:
1.  An active right C8/T1 radiculopathy.  Electrical abnormalities are moderate.
2.  An active right C6/C7 radiculopathy.  Electrical abnormalities are mild.
3.  Evidence of chronic left C8/T1 denervation.  No active denervation.
4.  Mild right lumbosacral radiculopathies.  This could not be further localized because of normal EMG testing in the lower extremity muscles.
5.  There is evidence of mild sensory carpal tunnel on the right (she has had previous carpal tunnel release).

Results were discussed with the patient.  It appears that she has failed conservative therapy and I have recommended to her that she return to Dr. X for his assessment for possible surgery to her C-spine.  She will continue with conservative therapy for the mild lumbosacral radiculopathies.

MEDICATIONS: 
 Plavix, atenolol, Lipitor, and folic acid.

CLINICAL HISTORY:  
This is a 41-year-old male patient who comes in with chest pain, had had a previous MI in 07/2003 and stents placement in 2003, who comes in for a stress myocardial perfusion scan.

With the patient at rest, 10.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.

PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION:  
The patient exercised for a total of 12 minutes on the standard Bruce protocol.  The peak workload was 12.8 METS.  The resting heart rate was 57 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 123 beats per minute, which was 69% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with a resting blood pressure of 130/100 and a peak blood pressure of 158/90.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and leg pain.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm.  The peak stress EKG did not reveal any ischemic ST-T wave abnormalities.  There was ventricular bigeminy seen during exercise, but no sustained tachycardia was seen.  At peak, there was no chest pain noted.  The test was stopped due to fatigue and left pain.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting myocardial perfusion imaging.

MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:

1.  The overall quality of the scan was good.
2.  There was no diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.
3.  The left ventricular cavity appeared normal in size.
4.  Gated SPECT images revealed mild septal hypokinesis and mild apical hypokinesis.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was low normal with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest.

CONCLUSIONS:

1.  Good exercise tolerance.
2.  Less than adequate cardiac stress.  The patient was on beta-blocker therapy.
3.  No EKG evidence of stress induced ischemia.
4.  No chest pain with stress.
5.  Mild ventricular bigeminy with exercise.
6.  No diagnostic abnormality on the rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging.
7.  Gated SPECT images revealed septal and apical hypokinesis with overall low normal left ventricular systolic function with calculated ejection fraction of 46% at rest.

EXAM:
MRI RIGHT KNEE WITHOUT GADOLINIUM

CLINICAL:
This is a 21-year-old male with right knee pain after a twisting injury on 7/31/05. Patient has had prior lateral meniscectomy in 2001.

FINDINGS:

Examination was performed on 8/3/05

Normal medial meniscus without intrasubstance degeneration, surface fraying or discrete meniscal tear.

There is subtle irregularity along the superior and inferior articular surfaces of the lateral meniscus, likely reflecting previous partial meniscectomy and contouring, although subtle surface tearing cannot be excluded, particularly along the undersurface of the lateral meniscus (series #3, image #17). There is no displaced tear or displaced meniscal fragment.

There is a mild interstitial sprain of the anterior cruciate ligament without focal tear or discontinuity.

Normal posterior cruciate ligament.

Normal medial collateral ligament.

There is a strain of the popliteus muscle and tendon without complete tear.

There is a sprain of the posterolateral and posterocentral joint capsule (series #5 images #10-18). There is marrow edema within the posterolateral corner of the tibia, and there is linear signal adjacent to the cortex suggesting that there may be a Segond fracture for which correlation with radiographs is recommended (series #6, images #4-7).

Biceps femoris tendon and iliotibial band are intact and there is no discrete fibular collateral ligament tear. Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons.

There is contusion within the posterior non-weight bearing surface of the medial femoral condyle, as well as in the posteromedial corner of the tibia. There is linear vertically oriented signal within the distal tibial diaphyseal-metaphyseal junction (series #7, image #8; series #2, images #4-5). There is no discrete fracture line, and this is of uncertain significance, but this should be correlated with radiographs.

The patellofemoral joint is congruent without patellar tilt or subluxation. Normal medial and lateral patellar retinacula. There is a joint effusion.

IMPRESSION:

Changes within the lateral meniscus most likely reflect previous partial meniscectomy and re-contouring although a subtle undersurface tear in the anterior horn may be present.

Mild anterior cruciate ligament interstitial sprain.

There is a strain of the popliteus muscle and tendon and there is a sprain of the posterolateral and posterocentral joint capsule with a possible Second fracture which should be correlated with radiographs.


EXAM:
  Nuclear medicine lymphatic scan.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Left breast cancer.

TECHNIQUE: 
 1.0 mCi of Technetium-99m sulfur colloid was injected within the dermis surrounding the left breast biopsy site at four locations.  A 16-hour left anterior oblique imaging was performed with and without shielding of the original injection site.

FINDINGS:  
There are two small foci of increased activity in the left axilla.  This is consistent with the sentinel lymph node.  No other areas of activity are visualized outside of the injection site and two axillary lymph nodes.

IMPRESSION:  
Technically successful lymph node injection with two areas of increased activity in the left axilla consistent with sentinel lymph node.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Coronary artery bypass surgery and aortic stenosis.

FINDINGS: 
 Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed of technically limited quality.  The left ventricle was normal in size and dimensions with normal LV function.  Ejection fraction was 50% to 55%.  Concentric hypertrophy noted with interventricular septum measuring 1.6 cm, posterior wall measuring 1.2 cm.  Left atrium is enlarged, measuring 4.42 cm.  Right-sided chambers are normal in size and dimensions.  Aortic root has normal diameter.

Mitral and tricuspid valve reveals annular calcification.  Fibrocalcific valve leaflets noted with adequate excursion.  Similar findings noted on the aortic valve as well with significantly adequate excursion of valve leaflets.  Atrial and ventricular septum are intact.  Pericardium is intact without any effusion.  No obvious intracardiac mass or thrombi noted.

Doppler study reveals mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.  Severe aortic stenosis with peak velocity of 2.76 with calculated ejection fraction 50% to 55% with severe aortic stenosis.  There is also mitral stenosis.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with left ventricular function.
2.  Moderate mitral regurgitation.
3.  Severe aortic stenosis, severe.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
 Transesophageal echocardiogram is clinically warranted to assess the aortic valve area.

CC:
 Decreasing visual acuity.

HX: 
This 62 y/o RHF presented locally with a 2 month history of progressive loss of visual acuity, OD. She had a 2 year history of progressive loss of visual acuity, OS, and is now blind in that eye. She denied any other symptomatology. Denied HA.

PMH:
 1) depression. 2) Blind OS

MEDS:
 None.

SHX/FHX:

EXAM:
 T36.0, BP121/85, HR 94, RR16

MS: Alert and oriented to person, place and time. Speech fluent and unremarkable.

CN: Pale optic disks, OU. Visual acuity: 20/70 (OD) and able to detect only shadow of hand movement (OS). Pupils were pharmacologically dilated earlier. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.

MOTOR: 5/5 throughout with normal bulk and tone.

Sensory: no deficits to LT/PP/VIB/PROP.

Coord: FNF-RAM-HKS intact bilaterally.

Station: No pronator drift. Gait: ND

Reflexes: 3/3 BUE, 2/2 BLE. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally.

Gen Exam: unremarkable. No carotid/cranial bruits.

COURSE:
 CT Brain showed large, enhancing 4 x 4 x 3 cm suprasellar-sellar mass without surrounding edema. Differential dx: included craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenoma, and aneurysm. MRI Brain findings were consistent with an aneurysm. The patient underwent 3 vessel cerebral angiogram on 12/29/92. This clearly revealed a supraclinoid giant aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. Ten minutes following contrast injection the patient became aphasic and developed a right hemiparesis. Emergent HCT showed no evidence of hemorrhage or sign of infarct. Emergent carotid duplex showed no significant stenosis or clot. The patient was left with an expressive aphasia and right hemiparesis. SPECT scans were obtained on 1/7/93 and 2/24/93. They revealed hypoperfusion in the distribution of the left MCA and decreased left basal-ganglia perfusion which may represent in part a mass effect from the LICA aneurysm. She was discharged home and returned and underwent placement of a Selverstone Clamp on 3/9/93. The clamp was gradually and finally closed by 3/14/93. She did well, and returned home. On 3/20/93 she developed sudden confusion associated with worsening of her right hemiparesis and right expressive aphasia. A HCT then showed SAH around her aneurysm, which had thrombosed. She was place on Nimodipine. Her clinical status improved; then on 3/25/93 she rapidly deteriorated over a 2 hour period to the point of lethargy, complete expressive aphasia, and right hemiplegia. An emergent HCT demonstrated a left ACA and left MCA infarction. She required intubation and worsened as cerebral edema developed. She was pronounced brain dead. Her organs were donated for transplant.

HDR BRACHYTHERAPY

The intracavitary brachytherapy applicator was placed appropriately and secured after the patient was identified.  Simulation films were obtained, documenting its positioning.  The 3-dimensional treatment planning process was accomplished utilizing the CT derived data.  A treatment plan was selected utilizing sequential dwell positions within a single catheter.  The patient was taken to the treatment area.  The patient was appropriately positioned and the position of the intracavitary device was checked.  Catheter length measurements were taken.  Appropriate measurements of the probe dimensions and assembly were also performed.  The applicator was attached to the HDR after-loader device.  The device ran through its checking sequences appropriately and the brachytherapy was then delivered without difficulty or complication.  The brachytherapy source was appropriately removed back to the brachytherapy safe within the device.  Radiation screening was performed with the Geiger-Muller counter both prior to and after the brachytherapy procedure was completed and the results were deemed appropriate.

Following completion of the procedure, the intracavitary device was removed without difficulty.  The patient was in no apparent distress and was discharged home.

CC:
 Confusion and slurred speech.

HX 
 (primarily obtained from boyfriend): This 31 y/o RHF experienced a &quot;flu-like illness 6-8 weeks prior to presentation. 3-4 weeks prior to presentation, she was found &quot;passed out&quot; in bed, and when awoken appeared confused, and lethargic. She apparently recovered within 24 hours. For two weeks prior to presentation she demonstrated emotional lability, uncharacteristic of her ( outbursts of anger and inappropriate laughter). She left a stove on.

She began slurring her speech 2 days prior to admission. On the day of presentation she developed right facial weakness and began stumbling to the right. She denied any associated headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, neck stiffness or visual change. There was no history of illicit drug/ETOH use or head trauma.

PMH:
 Migraine Headache.

FHX: 
 Unremarkable.

SHX: 
Divorced. Lives with boyfriend. 3 children alive and well. Denied tobacco/illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH.

ROS:
 Irregular menses.

EXAM: 
BP118/66.  HR83. RR 20. T36.8C.

MS: Alert and oriented to name only. Perseverative thought processes. Utilized only one or two word answers/phrases. Non-fluent. Rarely followed commands. Impaired writing of name.

CN: Flattened right nasolabial fold only.

Motor: Mild weakness in RUE manifested by pronator drift. Other extremities were full strength.

Sensory: withdrew to noxious stimulation in all 4 extremities.

Coordination: difficult to assess.

Station: Right pronator drift.

Gait: unremarkable.

Reflexes: 2/2BUE, 3/3BLE, Plantars were flexor bilaterally.

General Exam: unremarkable.

INITIAL STUDIES:
 CBC, GS, UA, PT, PTT, ESR, CRP, EKG were all unremarkable. Outside HCT showed hypodensities in the right putamen, left caudate, and at several subcortical locations (not specified).

COURSE: 
MRI Brian Scan, 2/11/92 revealed an old lacunar infarct in the right basal ganglia, edema within the head of the left caudate nucleus suggesting an acute ischemic event, and arterial enhancement of the left MCA distribution suggesting slow flow. The latter suggested a vasculopathy such as Moya Moya, or fibromuscular dysplasia. HIV, ANA, Anti-cardiolipin Antibody titer, Cardiac enzymes, TFTs, B12, and cholesterol studies were unremarkable.

She underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/12/92. This revealed an occlusion of the left MCA just distal to its origin. The distal distribution of the left MCA filled on later films through collaterals from the left ACA. There was also an occlusion of the right MCA just distal to the temporal branch. Distal branches of the right MCA filled through collaterals from the right ACA. No other vascular abnormalities were noted. These findings were felt to be atypical but nevertheless suspicious of a large caliber vasculitis such as Moya Moya disease. She was subsequently given this diagnosis. Neuropsychologic testing revealed widespread cognitive dysfunction with particular impairment of language function. She had long latencies responding and understood only simple questions. Affect was blunted and there was distinct lack of concern regarding her condition. She was subsequently discharged home on no medications.

In 9/92 she was admitted for sudden onset right hemiparesis and mental status change. Exam revealed the hemiparesis and in addition she was found to have significant neck lymphadenopathy. OB/GYN exam including cervical biopsy, and abdominal/pelvic CT scanning revealed stage IV squamous cell cancer of the cervix. She died 9/24/92 of cervical cancer.

EXAM: 
 Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound for deep venous thrombus.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Lower extremity edema bilaterally.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Colored, grayscale, and Doppler imaging is all employed.

FINDINGS: 
 This examination is limited.  There is prominent edema bilaterally and there is large body habitus.  These two limit assessment especially of the right lower extremity.

As visualized, there is no gross evidence of DVT.  The right leg grayscale images are limited.  No obvious clot identified on the color flow or Doppler images.  The left leg is better visualized than the right, but again is limited.  No definite clot is seen.

IMPRESSION: 
 Limited study secondary to body habitus and edema.  No obvious DVT as visualized.

CC:
 Confusion.

HX: 
 A 71 y/o RHM ,with a history of two strokes ( one in 11/90 and one in 11/91), had been in a stable state of health until 12/31/92 when he became confused, and displayed left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. The symptoms resolved within hours and recurred the following day. He was then evaluated locally and HCT revealed an old right parietal stroke. Carotid duplex scan revealed a &quot;high grade stenosis&quot; of the RICA. Cerebral Angiogram revealed 90%RICA and 50%LICA stenosis. He was then transferred to UIHC Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy. His confusion persisted and he was evaluated by Neurology on 1/8/93 and transferred to Neurology on 1/11/93.

PMH:
 1)cholecystectomy. 2)inguinal herniorrhaphies, bilaterally. 3)ETOH abuse: 3-10 beers/day. 4)Right parietal stroke 10/87 with residual left hemiparesis (Leg worse than arm). 5) 2nd stoke in distant past of unspecified type.

MEDS:
 None on admission.

FHX:
 Alzheimer's disease and stroke on paternal side of family.

SHX:

EXAM:
 BP137/70 HR81 RR13 O2Sat 95% Afebrile.

MS: Oriented to city and month, but did not know date or hospital. Naming and verbal comprehension were intact. He could tell which direction Iowa City and Des Moines were from Clinton and remembered 2-3 objects in two minutes, but both with assistance only. Incorrectly spelled &quot;world&quot; backward, as &quot;dlow.&quot;

CN: unremarkable except neglects left visual field to double simultaneous stimulation.

Motor: Deltoids 4+/4-, biceps 5-/4, triceps 5/4+, grip 4+/4+, HF4+/4-, HE 4+/4+, Hamstrings 5-/5-, AE 5-/5-, AF 5-/5-.

Sensory: intact PP/LT/Vib.

Coord: dysdiadochokinesis on RAM, bilaterally.

Station: dyssynergic RUE on FNF movement.

Gait: ND

Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout BUE and at patellae. Absent at ankles. Right plantar was flexor; and Left plantar was equivocal.

COURSE:
 CBC revealed normal Hgb, Hct, Plt and WBC, but Mean corpuscular volume was large at 103FL (normal 82-98). Urinalysis revealed 20+WBC. GS, TSH, FT4, VDRL, ANA and RF were unremarkable. He was treated for a UTI with amoxacillin. Vitamin B12 level was reduced at 139pg/ml (normal 232-1137). Schillings test was inconclusive dure to inability to complete a 24-hour urine collection. He was placed on empiric Vitamin B12 1000mcg IM qd x 7 days; then qMonth. He was also placed on Thiamine 100mg qd, Folate 1mg qd, and ASA 325mg qd. His ESR and CRP were elevated on admission, but fell as his UTI was treated.

EEG showed diffuse slowing and focal slowing in the theta-delta range in the right temporal area. HCT with contrast on 1/19/93 revealed a gyriform enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe consistent with a new infarct; and an old right parietal hypodensity (infarct). His confusion was ascribed to the UTI in the face of old and new strokes and Vitamin B12 deficiency. He was lost to follow-up and did not undergo carotid endarterectomy.

CC:
 Seizures.

HX: 
The patient was initially evaluated at UIHC at 7 years of age. He had been well until 7 months prior to evaluation when he started having spells which were described as &quot;dizzy spells&quot; lasting from several seconds to one minute in duration. They occurred quite infrequently and he was able to resume activity immediately following the episodes. The spell became more frequent and prolonged, and by the time of initial evaluation were occurring 2-3 times per day and lasting 2-3 minutes in duration. In addition, in the 3 months prior to evaluation, the right upper extremity would become tonic and flexed during the episodes, and he began to experience post ictal fatigue.

BIRTH HX:
 32 weeks gestation to a G4 mother and weighed 4#11oz. He was placed in an incubator for 3 weeks. He was jaundiced, but there was no report that he required treatment.

PMH: 
Single febrile convulsion lasting &quot;3 hours&quot; at age 2 years.

MEDS: 
none.

EXAM:
 Appears healthy and in no acute distress. Unremarkable general and neurologic exam.

Impression: Psychomotor seizures.

Studies: Skull X-Rays were unremarkable.

EEG showed &quot;minimal spike activity during hyperventilation, as well as random sharp delta activity over the left temporal area, in drowsiness and sleep. This record also showed moderate amplitude asymmetry ( left greater than right) over the frontal central and temporal areas, which is a peculiar finding.&quot;

COURSE:
 The patient was initially treated with Phenobarbital; then Dilantin was added (early 1970's); then Depakene was added ( early 1980's) due to poor seizure control. An EEG on 8/22/66 showed &quot;Left mid-temporal spike focus with surrounding slow abnormality, especially posterior to the anterior temporal areas (sparing the parasagittal region). In addition, the right lateral anterior hemisphere voltage is relatively depressed. ...this suggests two separate areas of cerebral pathology.&quot; He underwent his first HCT scan in Sioux City in 1981, and this revealed an right temporal arachnoid cyst. The patient had behavioral problems throughout elementary/junior high/high school. He underwent several neurosurgical evaluations at UIHC and Mayo Clinic and was told that surgery was unwarranted. He was placed on numerous antiepileptic medication combinations including Tegretol, Dilantin, Phenobarbital, Depakote, Acetazolamide, and Mysoline. Despite this he averaged 2-3 spells a month. He was last seen, 6/19/95, and was taking Dilantin and Tegretol. His typical spells were described as sudden in onset and without aura. He frequently becomes tonic or undergoes tonic-clonic movement and falls with associated loss of consciousness. He usually has rapid recovery and can return to work in 20 minutes. He works at a Turkey packing plant. Serial HCT scans showed growth in the arachnoid cyst until 1991, when growth arrest appeared to have occurred.

EXAM: 
 Dobutamine Stress Test.

INDICATION: 
 Chest pain.

TYPE OF TEST: 
 Dobutamine stress test, as the patient was unable to walk on a treadmill, and allergic to adenosine.

INTERPRETATION: 
 Resting heart rate of 66 and blood pressure of 88/45.  EKG, normal sinus rhythm.  Post dobutamine increment dose, his peak heart rate achieved was 125, which is 87% of the target heart rate.  Blood pressure 120/42.  EKG remained the same.  No symptoms were noted.

IMPRESSION:

1. Nondiagnostic dobutamine stress test.
2. Nuclear interpretation as below.

NUCLEAR INTERPRETATION: 
 Resting and stress images were obtained with 10.8, 30.2 mCi of tetrofosmin injected intravenously by standard protocol.  Nuclear myocardial perfusion scan demonstrates homogeneous and uniform distribution of the tracer uptake without any evidence of reversible or fixed defect.  Gated and SPECT revealed normal wall motion and ejection fraction of 75%.  End-diastolic volume was 57 and end-systolic volume of 12.

IMPRESSION:

1. Normal nuclear myocardial perfusion scan.
2. Ejection fraction of 75% by gated SPECT.

EXAM:
MRI RIGHT SHOULDER

CLINICAL:
 A 32-year-old male with shoulder pain.

FINDINGS:

This is a second opinion interpretation of the examination performed on 02/16/06.

Normal supraspinatus tendon without surface fraying, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy.

Normal infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons.

Normal long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove. There is no subluxation of the tendon under the transverse humeral ligament and the intracapsular portion of the tendon is normal.

Normal humeral head without fracture or subluxation.

There is myxoid degeneration within the superior labrum (oblique coronal images #47-48), but there is no discrete tear. The remaining portions of the labrum are normal without osseous Bankart lesion.

Normal superior, middle and inferior glenohumeral ligaments.

There is a persistent os acromiale, and there is minimal reactive marrow edema on both sides of the synchondrosis, suggesting that there may be instability (axial images #3 and 4). There is no diastasis of the acromioclavicular joint itself. There is mild narrowing of the subacromial space secondary to the os acromiale, in the appropriate clinical setting, this may be acting as an impinging lesion (sagittal images #56-59).

Normal coracoacromial, coracohumeral and coracoclavicular ligaments.

There are no effusions or masses.

IMPRESSION:

Changes in the superior labrum compatible with degeneration without a discrete surfacing tear.

There is a persistent os acromiale, and there is reactive marrow edema on both sides of the synchondrosis suggesting instability. There is also mild narrowing of the subacromial space secondary to the os acromiale. This may be acting as an impinging lesion in the appropriate clinical setting.

There is no evidence of a rotator cuff tear.

CC:

HX:
 29 y/o male with cerebral palsy, non-shunted hydrocephalus, spastic quadriplegia, mental retardation, bilateral sensory neural hearing loss, severe neurogenic scoliosis and multiple contractures of the 4 extremities, neurogenic bowel and bladder incontinence, and a history of seizures.

He was seen for evaluation of seizures which first began at age 27 years, two years before presentation. His typical episodes consist of facial twitching (side not specified), unresponsive pupils, and moaning. The episodes last approximately 1-2 minutes in duration and are followed by post-ictal fatigue. He was placed on DPH, but there was no record of an EEG prior to presentation.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Low back pain.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Low back pain.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:

1.  Lumbar discogram L2-3.
2.  Lumbar discogram L3-4.
3.  Lumbar discogram L4-5.
4.  Lumbar discogram L5-S1.

ANESTHESIA:  
IV sedation.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  
The patient was brought to the Radiology Suite and placed prone onto a radiolucent table.  The C-arm was brought into the operative field and AP, left right oblique and lateral fluoroscopic images of the L1-2 through L5-S1 levels were obtained.  We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile.  Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space.  A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined.  A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections.  A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus.  We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels.

A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially.

CC:
 Intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical, and torsional diplopia.

HX: 
70y/o RHM referred by Neuro-ophthalmology for evaluation of neuromuscular disease. In 7/91, he began experiencing intermittent binocular horizontal, vertical and torsional diplopia which was worse and frequent at the end of the day, and was eliminated when closing one either eye. An MRI Brain scan at that time was unremarkable. He was seen at UIHC Strabismus Clinic in 5/93 for these symptoms. On exam, he was found to have intermittent right hypertropia in primary gaze, and consistent diplopia in downward and rightward gaze. This was felt to possibly represent Grave's disease. Thyroid function studies were unremarkable, but orbital echography suggested Graves orbitopathy. The patient was then seen in the Neuro-ophthalmology clinic on 12/23/92. His exam remained unchanged. He underwent Tensilon testing which was unremarkable. On 1/13/93, he was seen again in Neuro-ophthalmology. His exam remained relatively unchanged and repeat Tensilon testing was unremarkable. He then underwent a partial superior rectus resection, OD, with only mild improvement of his diplopia. During his 8/27/96 Neuro-ophthalmology clinic visit he was noted to have hypertropia OD with left pseudogaze palsy and a right ptosis. The ptosis improved upon administration of Tensilon and he was placed on Mestinon 30mg tid. His diplopia subsequently improved, but did not resolve. The dosage was increased to 60mg tid and his diplopia worsened and the dose decreased back to 30mg tid. At present he denied any fatigue on repetitive movement. He denied dysphagia, SOB, dysarthria, facial weakness, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss or muscle atrophy.

MEDS:

Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor on the right and withdrawal on the left.

HEENT and GEN EXAM: Unremarkable.

COURSE:
 EMG/NCV, 9/26/96: Repetitive stimulation studies of the median, facial, and spinal accessory nerves showed no evidence of decrement at baseline, and at intervals up to 3 minutes following exercise. The patient had been off Mestinon for 8 hours prior to testing. Chest CT with contrast, 9/26/96, revealed a 4x2.5x4cm centrally calcified soft tissue anterior mediastinal mass adjacent to the aortic arch. This was highly suggestive of a thymoma. There were diffuse emphysematous disease with scarring in the lung bases. A few nodules suggestive of granulomas and few calcified perihilar lymph nodes. He underwent thoracotomy and resection of the mass. Pathologic analysis was consistent with a thymoma, lymphocyte predominant type, with capsular and pleural invasion, and extension to the phrenic nerve resection margin. Acetylcholine Receptor-binding antibody titer 12.8nmol/L (normal&lt;0.7), Acetylcholine receptor blocking antibody &lt;10% (normal), Acetylcholine receptor modulating antibody 42% (normal&lt;19), Striated muscle antibody 1:320 (normal&lt;1:10). Striated muscle antibody titers tend to be elevated in myasthenia gravis associated with thymoma.

EXAM:
 BP132/66 HR78 RR16 36.0C

MS: A&O to person, place, and time. No other specifics given in Neurosurgery/Otolaryngology/Neuro-ophthalmology notes.

CN: Visual acuity has declined from 20/40 to 20/400, OD; 20/30, OS. No RAPD. EOM was full and smooth and without nystagmus. Goldmann visual fields revealed a central scotoma and enlarged blind spot OD and OS (OD worse) with a normal periphery. Intraocular pressures were 15/14 (OD/OS). There was moderate pallor of the disc, OD. Facial sensation was decreased on the right side (V1 distribution).

Motor/Sensory/Coord/Station/Gait: were all unremarkable.

Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout. Plantars were flexor, bilaterally.

Gen Exam: unremarkable.

COURSE:
 MRI Brain, 10/7/92, revealed: a large 6x5x6cm slightly heterogeneous, mostly isointense lesion on both T1 and T2 weighted images arising from the planum sphenoidale and olfactory groove. The mass extends approximately 3.6cm superior to the planum into both frontal regions with edema in both frontal lobes. The mass extends 2.5cm inferiorly involving the ethmoid sinuses with resultant obstruction of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses.

It also extends into the superomedial aspect of the right maxillary sinus. There is probable partial encasement of both internal carotid arteries just above the siphon. The optic nerves are difficult to visualize but there is also probable encasement of these structures as well. The mass enhances significantly with gadolinium contrast. These finds are consistent with Meningioma.

The patient underwent excision of this tumor by simultaneous bifrontal craniotomy and lateral rhinotomy following an intrasinus biopsy which confirmed the meningioma. Postoperatively, he lost visual acuity, OS, but this gradually returned to baseline. His 9/6/96 neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed visual acuity of 20/25-3 (OD) and 20/80-2 (OS). His visual fields continued to abnormal, but improved and stable when compared to 10/92. His anosmia never resolved.

EXAM:
  CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast.

INDICATIONS:
  Abdominal pain.

TECHNIQUE:  
CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after 100 mL of intravenous Isovue-300 contrast administration.  Oral contrast was not administered.  There was no comparison of studies.

FINDINGS

CT PELVIS:

Within the pelvis, the uterus demonstrates a thickened-appearing endometrium.  There is also a 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm hypodense mass in the cervix and lower uterine segment of uncertain etiology.  There is also a 2.5 cm intramural hypodense mass involving the dorsal uterine fundus likely representing a fibroid.  Several smaller fibroids were also suspected.

The ovaries are unremarkable in appearance.  There is no free pelvic fluid or adenopathy.

CT ABDOMEN:

The appendix has normal appearance in the right lower quadrant.  There are few scattered diverticula in the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis.  The small and large bowels are otherwise unremarkable.  The stomach is grossly unremarkable.  There is no abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy.  There are no adrenal masses.  The kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are in unremarkable appearance.  The spleen contains several small calcified granulomas, but no evidence of masses.  It is normal in size.  The lung bases are clear bilaterally.  The osseous structures are unremarkable other than mild facet degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Hypoattenuating mass in the lower uterine segment and cervix of uncertain etiology measuring approximately 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm.
2.  Multiple uterine fibroids.
3.  Prominent endometrium.
4.  Followup pelvic ultrasound is recommended.

CLINICAL INDICATIONS: 
 MRSA bacteremia, rule out endocarditis.  The patient has aortic stenosis.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
 The transesophageal echocardiogram was performed after getting verbal and a written consent signed.  Then a multiplane TEE probe was introduced into the upper esophagus, mid esophagus, lower esophagus, and stomach and multiple views were obtained.  There were no complications.  The patient's throat was numbed with Cetacaine spray and IV sedation was achieved with Versed and fentanyl.

FINDINGS:

1.  Aortic valve is thick and calcified, a severely restricted end opening and there is 0.6 x 8 mm vegetation attached to the right coronary cusp.  The peak velocity across the aortic valve was 4.6 m/sec and mean gradient was 53 mmHg and peak gradient 84 mmHg with calculated aortic valve area of 0.6 sq cm by planimetry.
2.  Mitral valve is calcified and thick.  No vegetation seen.  There is mild-to-moderate MR present.  There is mild AI present also.
3.  Tricuspid valve and pulmonary valve are structurally normal.
4.  There is a mild TR present.
5.  There is no clot seen in the left atrial appendage.  The velocity in the left atrial appendage was 0.6 m/sec.
6.  Intraatrial septum was intact.  There is no clot or mass seen.
7.  Normal LV and RV systolic function.
8.  There is thick raised calcified plaque seen in the thoracic aorta and arch.

SUMMARY:

1.  There is a 0.6 x 0.8 cm vegetation present in the aortic valve with severe aortic stenosis.  Calculated aortic valve area was 0.6 sq. cm.
2.  Normal LV systolic function.


EXAM: 
 Single frontal view of the chest.

HISTORY: 
 Atelectasis.  Patient is status-post surgical correction for ASD.

TECHNIQUE: 
 A single frontal view of the chest was evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated mm/dd/yy.

FINDINGS:
  Current film reveals there is a right-sided central venous catheter, the distal tip appears to be in the superior vena cava.  Endotracheal tube with the distal tip appears to be in appropriate position, approximately 2 cm superior to the carina.  Sternotomy wires are noted.  They appear in appropriate placement.  There are no focal areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Once again seen is minimal amount of bilateral basilar atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears to be within normal limits at this time.  No evidence of any pneumothoraces or pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION:

1.  There has been interval placement of a right-sided central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, and sternotomy wires secondary to patient's most recent surgical intervention.
2.  Minimal bilateral basilar atelectasis with no significant interval changes from the patient's most recent prior.
3.  Interval decrease in the patient's heart size which may be secondary to the surgery versus positional and technique.

EXAM: 
 CT stone protocol.

REASON FOR EXAM:
  History of stones, rule out stones.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis per renal stone protocol.

FINDINGS: 
 Correlation is made with a prior examination dated 01/20/09.

Again identified are small intrarenal stones bilaterally.  These are unchanged.  There is no hydronephrosis or significant ureteral dilatation.  There is no stone along the expected course of the ureters or within the bladder.  There is a calcification in the low left pelvis not in line with ureter, this finding is stable and is compatible with a phlebolith.  There is no asymmetric renal enlargement or perinephric stranding.

The appendix is normal.  There is no evidence of a pericolonic inflammatory process or small bowel obstruction.

Scans through the pelvis disclose no free fluid or adenopathy.

Lung bases aside from very mild dependent atelectasis appear clear.

Given the lack of contrast, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas are grossly unremarkable.  The gallbladder is present.  There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy.

IMPRESSION:

1. Bilateral intrarenal stones, no obstruction.
2. Normal appendix.

HISTORY:
  The patient is a 46-year-old right-handed gentleman with a past medical history of a left L5-S1 lumbar microdiskectomy in 1998 with complete resolution of left leg symptoms, who now presents with a four-month history of gradual onset of right-sided low back pain with pain radiating down into his buttock and posterior aspect of his right leg into the ankle.  Symptoms are worsened by any activity and relieved by rest.  He also feels that when the pain is very severe, he has some subtle right leg weakness.  No left leg symptoms.  No bowel or bladder changes.

On brief examination, full strength in both lower extremities.  No sensory abnormalities.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the patellas and absent at both ankles.  Positive straight leg raising on the right.

MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals a right paracentral disc at L5-S1 encroaching upon the right exiting S1 nerve root.

NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:
  Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, and conduction velocities are normal in the lower extremities.  The right common peroneal F-wave is minimally prolonged.  The right tibial H reflex is absent.

NEEDLE EMG:
  Needle EMG was performed on the right leg, left gastrocnemius medialis muscle, and right lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It revealed spontaneous activity in the right gastrocnemius medialis, gluteus maximus, and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles.  There was evidence of chronic denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis and gluteus maximus muscles.

IMPRESSION: 
 This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals an acute right S1 radiculopathy.  There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy or left or right L5 radiculopathy.

Results were discussed with the patient and he is scheduled to follow up with Dr. X in the near future.

CC:
 Orthostatic lightheadedness.

HX:
 This 76 y/o male complained of several months of generalized weakness and malaise, and a two week history of progressively worsening orthostatic dizziness. The dizziness worsened when moving into upright positions. In addition, he complained of intermittent throbbing holocranial headaches, which did not worsen with positional change, for the past several weeks. He had lost 40 pounds over the past year and denied any recent fever, SOB, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, hemoptysis, melena, hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum, polyuria, night sweats, visual changes, or syncopal episodes.

He had a 100+ pack-year history of tobacco use and continued to smoke 1 to 2 packs per day. He has a history of sinusitis.

EXAM:
 BP 98/80 mmHg and pulse 64 BPM (supine); BP 70/palpable mmHG and pulse 84BPM (standing). RR 12, Afebrile. Appeared fatigued.

CN: unremarkable.

Motor and Sensory exam: unremarkable.

Coord: Slowed but otherwise unremarkable movements.

Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all 4 extremities. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.

The rest of the neurologic and general physical exam was unremarkable.

LAB:
 Na 121 meq/L, K 4.2 meq/L, Cl 90 meq/L, CO2 20meq/L, BUN 12mg/DL, CR 1.0mg/DL, Glucose 99mg/DL, ESR 30mm/hr, CBC WNL with nl WBC differential, Urinalysis: SG 1.016 and otherwise WNL, TSH 2.8 IU/ML, FT4 0.9ng/DL, Urine Osmolality 246 MOSM/Kg (low), Urine Na 35 meq/L,

COURSE:
 The patient was initially hydrated with IV normal saline and his orthostatic hypotension resolved, but returned within 24-48hrs. Further laboratory studies revealed: Aldosterone (serum)&lt;2ng/DL (low), 30 minute Cortrosyn Stimulation test: pre 6.9ug/DL (borderline low), post 18.5ug/DL (normal stimulation rise), Prolactin 15.5ng/ML (no baseline given), FSH and LH were within normal limits for males. Testosterone 33ng/DL (wnl). Sinus XR series (done for history of headache) showed an abnormal sellar region with enlarged sella tursica and destruction of the posterior clinoids. There was also an abnormal calcification seen in the middle of the sellar region. A left maxillary sinus opacity with air-fluid level was seen. Goldman visual field testing was unremarkable. Brain CT and MRI revealed suprasellar mass most consistent with pituitary adenoma. He was treated with Fludrocortisone 0.05 mg BID and within 24hrs, despite discontinuation of IV fluids, remained hemodynamically stable and free of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. His presumed pituitary adenoma continues to be managed with Fludrocortisone as of this writing (1/1997), though he has developed dementia felt secondary to cerebrovascular disease (stroke/TIA).

CARDIOLITE TREADMILL EXERCISE STRESS TEST

CLINICAL DATA:
  This is a 72-year-old female with history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and right bundle branch block.

PROCEDURE:
  The patient was exercised on the treadmill to maximum tolerance achieving after 5 minutes a peak heart rate of 137 beats per minute with a workload of 2.3 METS.  There was a normal blood pressure response.  The patient did not complain of any symptoms during the test and other than the right bundle branch block that was present at rest, no other significant electrographic abnormalities were observed.

Myocardial perfusion imaging was performed at rest following the injection of 10 mCi Tc-99 Cardiolite.  At peak pharmacological effect, the patient was injected with 30 mCi Tc-99 Cardiolite.

Gating poststress tomographic imaging was performed 30 minutes after the stress.

FINDINGS:

1.  The overall quality of the study is fair.
2.  The left ventricular cavity appears to be normal on the rest and stress studies.
3.  SPECT images demonstrate fairly homogeneous tracer distribution throughout the myocardium with no overt evidences of fixed and/or reperfusion defect.
4.  The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal and estimated to be 78%.

IMPRESSION: 
 Myocardial perfusion imaging is normal.  Result of this test suggests low probability for significant coronary artery disease.

PROCEDURE: 
 Bilateral L5, S1, S2, and S3 radiofrequency ablation.

INDICATION: 
 Sacroiliac joint pain.

INFORMED CONSENT: 
 The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.

The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.

The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.

PROCEDURE: 
 Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.

The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.

With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.

The following technique was used to confirm correct placement.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration.  No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts.  Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue.  After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds.

All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.

ADDITIONAL DETAILS:  
None.

COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.

DISCUSSION: 
 Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.

The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.

Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
  Minimal.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
 The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the usual supine position.  At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.

Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.

A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot.  The patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well.  Dr. A was present throughout the entire case.

CC: 
Headache (HA)

HX:
 10 y/o RHM awoke with a bilateral parieto-occipital HA associated with single episode of nausea and vomiting, 2 weeks prior to presentation. The nausea and vomiting resolved and did not recur. However, he continued to experience similar HA 3-4 times per week during the early morning upon awakening. He never felt the HA awakened him from sleep. The HA were partially relieved by Tylenol or Advil, and he distracted himself from the pain by remaining active. One week prior to presentation, he started to experience short episodes of blurred vision and diplopia. He also became fatigued, less active, and frequently yawned.

He had no prior history of HA and he and his family denied any sign or symptom of focal weakness or numbness, dysphagia, dysarthria, or loss of consciousness.

The patient underwent an MRI brain scan prior to transfer to UIHC. This revealed a mass in the left frontal region adjacent to the left temporal horn. The mass was an inhomogeneous blend of signals on T1 and T2 images giving a suggestion of acute bleeding, hemosiderin deposition and multiple vessels within the mass.

MEDS:
 None.

PMH:
 1) He was a 7# 15oz. product of a full term, uncomplicated pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. His post-partum course was unremarkable. 2)Developmental milestones were reached at the appropriate times; though he was diagnosed with dyslexia 4 years ago. 3) No significant illnesses or hospitalizations.

HEENT: no meningismus. no cranial bruits. no skull defects palpated.

GEN EXAM: unremarkable.

COURSE:
 GS, PT/PTT, CBC were unremarkable. The MRI finding above lead to a differential diagnosis of Venous Angioma, Arteriovenous Malformation, Ependymoma, Neurocytoma, Glioma: all with associated hemorrhage.

He underwent cerebral angiography on 1/25/93. Upon injection of the RCCA an avascular mass was identified in the right temporal lobe displacing the anterior choroidal artery, and temporal branches of the middle cerebral arteries. The internal cerebral vein is displaced to the left suggesting mass effect. There is a hypoplastic A1 segment and fetal origin of the LPCA. The mass was felt by neuroradiology to represent a hematoma.

He underwent a right frontal craniotomy, 1/28/93. Pathological evaluation of the resected tissue was consistent with a vascular malformation with inclusive reactive glial tissue and evidence of recurrent and remote hemorrhage. There were dilated vascular channels having walls of variable thickness, but without evidence of elastic lamina by elastic staining. This was consistent with venous angioma/malformation.

INDICATION: 
 Chest pain.

2.  Tun-L catheter placement with injection of steroid solution and Marcaine at L45 nerve roots left.
3.  Interpretation of radiograph.

ANESTHESIA: 
 IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
  None.

COMPLICATIONS:
  None.

INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: 
 Severe and excruciating pain in the lumbar spine and lower extremity.  MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.

SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.

The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.

After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.

An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed&reg; Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.

Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction.

EXAM:
  Skull, complete, five images

HISTORY:
  Plagiocephaly.

TECHNIQUE:

        EXAM:  CT Scan of the brain without contrast.

REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Face asleep.

COMPARISON EXAMINATION:  None.

TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images were obtained of the brain.  5 mm sections were acquired.  2.5-mm sections were acquired without injection of intravenous contrast.  Reformatted sagittal and coronal images were obtained.

DISCUSSION:  No acute intracranial abnormalities appreciated.  No evidence for hydrocephalus, midline shift, space occupying lesions or abnormal fluid collections.  No cortical based abnormalities appreciated.  The sinuses are clear.  No acute bony abnormalities identified.

Preliminary report given to emergency room at conclusion of exam by Dr. Xyz.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormalities appreciated.

        This is a low stress, high rest 1-day protocol; however the patient had the resting study done today.

CLINICAL INDICATION:
  Chest pain.

INTERPRETATION: 
 The patient received 14.9 mCi of Cardiolite for the rest portion of the study and 11.5 mCi of Cardiolite for the stress portion of the study.

The patient's baseline EKG was normal sinus rhythm.  The patient was stressed according to Bruce protocol by Dr. X.  Exercise test was supervised and interpreted by Dr. X.  Please see the separate report for stress portion of the study.

The myocardial perfusion SPECT study shows there is mild anteroseptal fixed defect seen, which is most likely secondary to soft tissue attenuation artifact.  There is, however, mild partially reversible perfusion defect seen, which is more pronounced in the stress images and short-axis view suggestive of minimal ischemia in the inferolateral wall.

The gated SPECT study shows normal wall motion and wall thickening with calculated left ventricular ejection fraction of 59%.

CONCLUSION:

1.  The exercise myocardial perfusion study shows possibility of mild ischemia in the inferolateral wall.
2.  Normal LV systolic function with LV ejection fraction of 59%.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the skull base without contrast.

FINDINGS: 
 There is mild generalized atrophy.  Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation are seen within the sub cortical and periventricular white matter compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation with no evidence of mass, hemorrhage, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  The bony calvarium and skull base are within normal limits.  

IMPRESSION: 
 No acute abnormalities.

 Negative for acute intracranial disease.

CT CERVICAL SPINE

TECHNIQUE:  
Noncontrast axial CT images of the cervical spine were obtained.  Sagittal and coronal images were obtained.

FINDINGS:
  Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis is compatible with patient position versus muscle spasms.  No fracture or subluxation is seen.  Anterior and posterior osteophyte formation is seen at C5-C6.  No abnormal anterior cervical soft tissue swelling is seen.  No spinal compression is noted.  The atlanto-dens interval is normal.  There is a large retention cyst versus polyp within the right maxillary sinus.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis compatible with patient positioning versus muscle spasms.
2.  Degenerative disk and joint disease at C5-C6.
3.  Retention cyst versus polyp of the right maxillary sinus.

HISTORY:
  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of diet-controlled diabetes, diffuse arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps who presents with a few-month history of numbness in both big toes and up the lateral aspect of both calves.  Symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago.  This normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time.  She was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms.  She is almost asymptomatic at present.  She dose complain of longstanding low back pain, but no pain that radiates from her back into her legs.  She has had no associated weakness.

On brief examination, straight leg raising is normal.  The patient is obese.  There is mild decreased vibration and light touch in distal lower extremities.  Strength is full and symmetric.  Deep tendon reflexes at the knees are 2+ and symmetric and absent at the ankles.

NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: 
 Bilateral sural sensory responses are absent.  Bilateral superficial sensory responses are present, but mildly reduced.  The right radial sensory response is normal.  The right common peroneal and tibial motor responses are normal.  Bilateral H-reflexes are absent.

NEEDLE EMG:
  Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the left tibialis posterior using a concentric disposable needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right tibialis posterior muscle with signs of mild chronic denervation in bilateral peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle.  Lumbar paraspinals were attempted, but were too painful to get a good assessment.

IMPRESSION:  
This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:
1.  A very mild, purely sensory length-dependent peripheral neuropathy.
2.  Mild bilateral L5 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.

Based on the patient's history and exam, her new symptoms are consistent with mild bilateral L5 radiculopathies.  Symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting Elavil.  I would recommend MRI of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return.  With respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance/early diabetes.  However, I would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following:  Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis and Lyme titer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 I was kindly asked to see this patient for transesophageal echocardiogram performance by Dr. A and Neurology.  Please see also my cardiovascular consultation dictated separately.  But essentially, this is a pleasant 72-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a large right MCA CVA causing a left-sided neurological deficit incidentally found to have atrial fibrillation on telemetry.  She has been recommended for a transesophageal echocardiogram for cardioembolic source of her CNS insult.

I discussed the procedure in detail with the patient as well as with her daughter, who was present at the patient's bedside with the patient's verbal consent.  I then performed a risk/benefit/alternative analysis with benefits being more definitive exclusion of intracardiac thrombus as well as assessment for intracardiac shunts; alternatives being transthoracic echo imaging, which she had already had, with an inherent false negativity for this indication as well as empiric medical management, which the patient was not interested in; risks including, but not limited to, and the patient was aware this was not an all-inclusive list, of oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, risk of oropharyngeal, esophageal, oral, tracheal, pulmonary and/or gastric perforation, hemorrhage, or tear.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk/benefit/alternative analysis, had the opportunity to ask questions, which I invited from her and her daughter, all of which were answered to their self-stated satisfaction.  The patient then stated in a clear competent and coherent fashion that she wished to go forward with the transesophageal echocardiogram.

PROCEDURE: 
 The appropriate time-out procedure was performed as per Medical Center protocol under my direct supervision with appropriate identification of the patient, position, physician, procedure documentation; there were no safety issues identified by staff nor myself.  She received 20 cc of viscous lidocaine for topical oral anesthetic effect.  She received a total of 4 mg of Versed and 100 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrated conscious sedation with continuous hemodynamic and oximetric monitoring with reasonable effect.  The multi-plane probe was passed using digital guidance for several passes, after an oral bite block had been put into place for protection of oral dentition.  This was placed into the posterior oropharynx and advanced into the esophagus, then advanced into the stomach and then rotated and withdrawn and removed with adequate imaging obtained throughout.  She was recovered as per the Medical Center conscious sedation protocol, and there were no apparent complications of the procedure.

FINDINGS: 
 Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  LVEF of 60%.  Mild left atrial enlargement.  Normal right atrial size.  Normal right ventricular size and systolic function.  No left ventricular wall motion abnormalities identified.  The four pulmonary veins are identified.  The left atrial appendage is interrogated, including with Doppler and color flow, and while there is good to-and-fro motion seen, echo smoke is seen, and in fact, an intracardiac thrombus is identified and circumscribed at 1.83 cm in circumference at the base of the left atrial appendage.  No intracardiac vegetations nor endocarditis seen on any of the intracardiac valves.  The mitral valve is seen.  There is mild mitral regurgitation with two jets.  No mitral stenosis.  Four pulmonary veins were identified without reversible pulmonary venous flow.  There are three cusps of the aortic valve seen.  No aortic stenosis.  There is trace aortic insufficiency.  There is trace pulmonic insufficiency.  The pulmonary artery is seen and is within normal limits.  There is trace to mild tricuspid regurgitation.  Unable to estimate PA systolic pressure accurately; however, on the recent transthoracic echocardiogram (which I would direct the reader to) on January 5, 2010, RVSP was calculated at 40 mmHg on that study.  E wave velocity on average is 0.95 m/sec with a deceleration time of 232 milliseconds.  The proximal aorta is within normal limits, annulus 1.19 cm, sinuses of Valsalva 2.54 cm, ascending aorta 2.61 cm.  The intra-atrial septum is identified as are the SVC and IVC, and these are within normal limits.  The intra-atrial septum is interrogated with color flow as well as agitated D5W and there is no evidence of intracardiac shunting, including no atrial septal defect nor patent foramen ovale.  No pericardial effusion.  There is mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis seen.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Normal left ventricular size and systolic function.  Left ventricular ejection fraction visually estimated at 60% without regional wall motion abnormalities.
2.  Mild left atrial enlargement.
3.  Intracardiac thrombus identified at the base of the left atrial appendage.
4.  Mild mitral regurgitation with two jets.
5.  Mild nonmobile descending aortic atherosclerosis.

Compared to the transthoracic echocardiogram done previously, other than identification of the intracardiac thrombus, other findings appear quite similar.

These results have been discussed with Dr. A of inpatient Internal Medicine service as well as the patient, who was recovering from conscious sedation, and her daughter with the patient's verbal consent.
        The patient is a 39-year-old gravida 3, para 2, who is now at 20 weeks and 2 days gestation.  This pregnancy is a twin gestation.  The patient presents for her fetal anatomical survey.  The patient has past obstetrical history notable for a full-term vaginal delivery with 6 pounds, 15 ounce female infant in 2001.  She also had a full-term vaginal delivery with 7 pound, 11 ounce male infant in 2002.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
The patient denies any significant past medical history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 
 The patient denies any significant surgical history.

MEDICATIONS: 
 The patient takes no medications.

ALLERGIES: 
 No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 She denies use of cigarettes, alcohol or drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY: 
 No family history of birth defects, mental retardation or any psychiatric history.

DETAILS: 
 I performed a transabdominal ultrasound today using a 4 MHz transducer.  There is a twin gestation in the vertex transverse lie with an anterior placenta and a normal amount of amniotic fluid surrounding both of the twins.  The fetal biometry of twin A is as follows.  The biparietal diameter is 4.9 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, head circumference 17.6 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 1 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, and femur length is 3.1 cm consistent with 19 weeks and 5 days, and the humeral length is 3.0 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day.  The average gestational age by ultrasound is 20 weeks and 1 day and the estimated fetal weight is 353 g.  The following structures are seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey, the shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels and the placenta.

Limited in views of baby A with a nasolabial region.

The following is the fetal biometry for twin B. The biparietal diameter is 4.7 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, head circumference 17.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 0 day, the abdominal circumference is 15.5 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 5 days, the femur length is 3.3 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 3 days, and the humeral length is 3.1 cm consistent with 20 weeks and 2 days, the average gestational age by ultrasound is 22 weeks and 2 days, and the estimated fetal weight is 384 g.  The following structures were seen as normal on the fetal anatomical survey.  The shape of the fetal head, the choroid plexuses, the cerebellum, nuchal fold thickness, the fetal spine and fetal face, the four-chamber view of the fetal heart, the outflow tracts of the fetal heart, the stomach, the kidneys, and cord insertion site, the bladder, the extremities, the genitalia, the cord, which appeared to have three vessels, and the placenta.  Limited on today's ultrasound the views of nasolabial region.

In summary, this is a twin gestation, which may well be monochorionic at 20 weeks and 1 day.  There is like gender and a single placenta.  One cannot determine with certainty whether or not this is a monochorionic or dichorionic gestation from the ultrasound today.

I sat with the patient and her husband and discussed alternative findings and the complications.  We focused our discussion today on the association of twin pregnancy with preterm delivery.  We discussed the fact that the average single intrauterine pregnancy delivers at 40 weeks' gestation while the average twin delivery occurs at 35 weeks' gestation.  We discussed the fact that 15% of twins deliver prior to 32 weeks' gestation.  These are the twins which we have the most concern regarding the long-term prospects of prematurity.  We discussed several etiologies of preterm delivery including preterm labor, incompetent cervix, premature rupture of the fetal membranes as well as early delivery from preeclampsia and growth restriction.  We discussed the use of serial transvaginal ultrasound to assess for early cervical change and the use of serial transabdominal ultrasound to assess for normal interval growth.  We discussed the need for frequent office visits to screen for preeclampsia.  We also discussed treatment options such as cervical cerclage, bedrest, tocolytic medications, and antenatal steroids.  I would recommend that the patient return in two weeks for further cervical assessment and assessment of fetal growth and well-being.

In closing, I do want to thank you very much for involving me in the care of your delightful patient.  I did review all of the above findings and recommendations with the patient today at the time of her visit.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I could be of any further help to you.

Total visit time 40 minutes.
        EXAM:  CT-guided needle placement, CT-guided biopsy of right renal mass, and embolization of biopsy tract with gelfoam.

REASON FOR EXAM:  This 60-year-old female who was found to have a solid indeterminate mass involving the inferior pole of the right kidney was referred for percutaneous biopsy under CT guidance at the request of Dr. X.

PROCEDURE:  The procedure risks and possible complications including, but not limited to severe hemorrhage which could result in emergent surgery, were explained to the patient.  The patient understood.  All questions were answered, and informed consent was obtained.  With the patient in the prone position, noncontrasted CT localization images were obtained through the kidney.  Conscious sedation was utilized with the patient being monitored.  The patient was administered divided dose of Versed and fentanyl intravenously.

Following sterile preparation and local anesthesia to the posterior aspect of the right flank, an 18-gauge co-axial Temno-type needle was directed into the inferior pole right renal mass from the posterior oblique approach.  Two biopsy specimens were obtained and placed in 10% formalin solution.  CT documented needle placement.  Following the biopsy, there was active bleeding through the stylet, as well as a small hematoma about the inferior aspect of the right kidney posteriorly.  I placed several torpedo pledgets of Gelfoam through the co-axial sheath into the site of bleeding.  The bleeding stopped.  The co-axial sheath was then removed.  Bandage was applied.  Hemostasis was obtained.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  Postbiopsy CT images were then obtained.  The patient's hematoma appeared stable.  The patient was without complaints of pain or discomfort.  The patient was then sent to her room with plans of observing for approximately 4 hours and then to be discharged, as stable.  The patient was instructed to remain at bedrest for the remaining portions of the day at home and patient is to followup with Dr. Fieldstone for the results and follow-up care.

FINDINGS:  Initial noncontrasted CT localization images reveals the presence of an approximately 2.1 cm cortical mass involving the posterior aspect of the inferior pole of the right kidney.  Images obtained during the biopsy reveals the cutting portion of the biopsy needle to extend through the mass.  Images obtained following the biopsy reveals the development of a small hematoma posterior to the right kidney in its inferior pole adjacent to the mass.  There are small droplets of air within the hematoma.  No hydronephrosis is identified.

CONCLUSION:
1.  Percutaneous biopsy of inferior pole right renal mass under computed tomography guidance with specimen sent to laboratory in 10% formalin solution.
2.  Development of a small hematoma adjacent to the inferior pole of the right kidney with active bleeding through the biopsy needle stopped by tract embolization with Gelfoam pledgets.
        A 51-year-old male with chest pain and history of coronary artery disease.

COMPARISON:
 None.

MEDICATIONS:
 Lopressor 5mg IV at 0920 hours.

HEART RATE: 
Recorded heart rate 55 to 57bpm.

EXAM:
Initial unenhanced axial CT imaging of the heart was obtained with ECG gating for the purpose of coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston Method) and calcium volume determination.

18 gauge IV Intracath was inserted into the right antecubital vein.

A 20cc saline bolus was injected intravenously to confirm vein patency and adequacy of venous access.

Multi-detector CT imaging was performed with a 64 slice MDCT scanner with images obtained from the mid ascending aorta to the diaphragm at 0.5mm slice thickness during breath-holding.

95 cc of Isovue was administered followed by a 90cc saline bolus chaser. Image reconstruction was performed using retrospective cardiac gating. Calcium scoring analysis (Agatston Method and volume determination) was performed.

FINDINGS:

CALCIUM SCORE:  The patient's total Agatston calcium score is: 115. The Agatston score for the individual vessels are: LM: 49. RCA: 1. LAD: 2. CX: 2. Other: 62. The Agatston calcium score places the patient in the 90th percentile, which means 10 percent of the male population in this age group would have a higher calcium score.

QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
  Examination is of good quality with good bolus timing and good demonstration of coronary arteries.

LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY:
  The left main coronary artery has a posteriorly positioned take-off from the valve cusp, with a patent ostium, and it has an extramural (non-malignant) course. The vessel is of moderate size. There is an apparent second ostium, in a more normal anatomic location, but quite small. This has an extramural (non-malignant) course. There is mixed calcific/atheromatous plaque within the distal vessel, as well as positive remodeling. There is no high grade stenosis but a flow-limiting lesion can not be excluded. The vessel trifurcates into a left anterior descending artery, a ramus intermedius and a left circumflex artery.

LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING CORONARY ARTERY:
  The left anterior descending artery is a moderate-size vessel, with ostial calcific plaque and soft plaque without a high-grade stenosis, but there may be a flow-limiting lesion here. There is a moderate size bifurcating first diagonal branch with ostial calcification, but no flow-limiting lesion. LAD continues as a moderate-size vessel to the posterior apex of the left ventricle.

Ramus intermedius branch is a moderate to large-size vessel with extensive calcific plaque, but no ostial stenosis. The dense calcific plaque limits evaluation of the vessel lumen, and a flow-limiting lesion within the proximal vessel cannot be excluded. The vessel continues as a small vessel on the left lateral ventricular wall.

LEFT CIRCUMFLEX CORONARY ARTERY:
 The left circumflex artery is a moderate-size vessel with a normal ostium giving rise to a small OM1 branch and a large OM2 branch supplying much of the posterolateral wall of the left ventricular. The AV-groove branch tapers at the base of the heart. There is minimal calcific plaque within the mid vessel, but there is no flow-limiting stenosis.

RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:
 The right coronary artery is a large vessel with a normal ostium giving rise to a moderate-size acute marginal branch and continuing as a large vessel to the crux of the heart supplying a left posterior descending artery and small posterolateral ventricular branches. There is minimal calcific plaque within the mid vessel, but there is no flow-limiting lesion.

Coronary circulation is right dominant.

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS:
 End diastolic volume: 106ml End systolic volume: 44ml Ejection fraction: 58 percent

ANATOMIC ANALYSIS:

Normal heart size with no demonstrated ventricular wall abnormalities. There are no demonstrated myocardial

bridges. Normal left atrial appendage with no evidence of thrombosis.

Cardiac valves are normal.

The aortic diameter measures 33mm just distal to the sino-tubular junction. The visualized thoracic aorta appears normal in size.

Normal pericardium without pericardial thickening or effusion.

There is no demonstrated mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. The visualized lung parenchyma is unremarkable.

There are two left and two right pulmonary veins.

IMPRESSION:

Ventricular function: Normal.

Single vessel coronary artery analysis:
LM: There is a posterior origin from the valve cusp. There is mixed calcific/atheromatous plaque and positive remodeling plaque within the LM, and although there is no high grade stenosis, a flow-limiting lesion can not be excluded. In addition, there is an apparent second ostium of indeterminate significance, but both ostia have extramural (non-malignant) courses.

LAD: Dense calcific plaque within the proximal vessel with ostial calcification and possible flow-limiting proximal lesion. There is a ramus branch with dense calcific plaque limiting evaluation of the vessel lumen, but a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here.

CX: Minimal calcific plaque with no flow-limiting lesion.

RCA: Minimal calcific plaque with no flow-limiting lesion.

Coronary artery dominance: Right.

EXAM:  
Bilateral diagnostic mammogram, left breast ultrasound and biopsy.

HISTORY: 
 30-year-old female presents for digital bilateral mammography secondary to a soft tissue lump palpated by the patient in the upper right shoulder.  The patient has a family history of breast cancer within her mother at age 58.  Patient denies personal history of breast cancer.

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  
Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections of bilateral breasts were obtained on mm/dd/yy.  An additional lateromedial projection of the right breast was obtained.  The breasts demonstrate heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  Within the upper outer aspect of the left breast, there is evidence of a circumscribed density measuring approximately 1 cm x 0.7 cm in diameter.  No additional dominant mass, areas of architectural distortion, or malignant-type calcifications are seen.  Multiple additional benign-appearing calcifications are visualized bilaterally.  Skin overlying both breasts is unremarkable.

Bilateral breast ultrasound was subsequently performed, which demonstrated an ovoid mass measuring approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm in diameter located within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder.  This mass demonstrates isoechoic echotexture to the adjacent muscle, with no evidence of internal color flow.  This may represent benign fibrous tissue or a lipoma.

Additional ultrasonographic imaging of the left breast demonstrates a complex circumscribed solid and cystic lesion with hypervascular properties at the 2 o'clock position, measuring 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.8 cm in diameter.  At this time, the lesion was determined to be amenable by ultrasound-guided core biopsy.

The risks and complications of the procedure were discussed with the patient for biopsy of the solid and cystic lesion of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast.  Informed consent was obtained.  The lesion was re-localized under ultrasound guidance.  The left breast was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  2% lidocaine was administered locally for anesthesia.  Additional lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the distal aspect of the lesion.  A small skin nick was made.  Color Doppler surrounding the lesion demonstrates multiple vessels surrounding the lesion at all sides.  The lateral to medial approach was performed with an 11-gauge Mammotome device.  The device was advanced under ultrasound guidance, with the superior aspect of the lesion placed within the aperture.  Two core biopsies were obtained.  The third core biopsy demonstrated evidence of an expanding hypoechoic area surrounding the lesion, consistent with a rapidly-expanding hematoma.  Arterial blood was visualized exiting the access site.  A biopsy clip was attempted to be placed, however could not be performed secondary to the active hemorrhage.  Therefore, the Mammotome was removed, and direct pressure over the access site and biopsy location was applied for approximately 20 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.  Postprocedural imaging of the 2 o'clock position of the left breast demonstrates evidence of a hematoma measuring approximately 1.9 x 4.4 x 1.3 cm in diameter.  The left breast was re-cleansed with a ChloraPrep, and a pressure bandage and ice packing were applied to the left breast.  The patient was observed in the ultrasound department for the following 30 minutes without complaints.  The patient was subsequently discharged with information and instructions on utilizing the ice bandage.  The obtained specimens were sent to pathology for further analysis.

IMPRESSION:

1.  A mixed solid and cystic lesion at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was accessed under ultrasound guidance utilizing a Mammotome core biopsy instrument, and multiple core biopsies were obtained.  Transient arterial hemorrhage was noted at the biopsy site, resulting in a localized 4 cm hematoma.  Pressure was applied until hemostasis was achieved.  The patient was monitored for approximately 30 minutes after the procedure, and was ultimately discharged in good condition.  The core biopsies were submitted to pathology for further analysis.
2.  Small isoechoic ovoid mass within the anteromedial aspect of the left shoulder does not demonstrate color flow, and likely represents fibrotic changes or a lipoma.
3.  Suspicious mammographic findings.  The circumscribed density measuring approximately 8 mm at the 2 o'clock position of the left breast was subsequently biopsied.  Further pathologic analysis is pending.

BIRADS Classification 4 - Suspicious findings.

MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:

1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.
2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.
3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.

EXAM: 
 Right foot series.

REASON FOR EXAM:  
Injury.

FINDINGS: 
 Three images of the right foot were obtained.  On the AP image only, there is a subtle lucency seen in the proximal right fourth metatarsal and a mild increased sclerosis in the proximal fifth metatarsal.  Also on a single image, there is a lucency seen in the lateral aspect of the calcaneus that is seen on the oblique image only.  Fractures in these bones cannot be completely excluded.  There is soft tissue swelling seen overlying the calcaneus within this region.

IMPRESSION: 
 Cannot exclude nondisplaced fractures in the lateral aspect of the calcaneus or at the base of the fourth and fifth metatarsals.  Recommend correlation with site of pain in addition to conservative management and followup imaging.  A phone call will be placed to the emergency room regarding these findings.

EXAM: 
 CTA chest pulmonary angio.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Postcontrast CT chest pulmonary embolism protocol, 100 mL of Isovue-300 contrast is utilized.

FINDINGS: 
 There are no filling defects in the main or main right or left pulmonary arteries.  No central embolism.  The proximal subsegmental pulmonary arteries are free of embolus, but the distal subsegmental and segmental arteries especially on the right are limited by extensive pulmonary parenchymal, findings would be discussed in more detail below.  There is no evidence of a central embolism.

As seen on the prior examination, there is a very large heterogeneous right chest wall mass, which measures at least 10 x 12 cm based on axial image #35.  Just superior to the mass is a second heterogeneous focus of neoplasm measuring about 5 x 3.3 cm.  Given the short interval time course from the prior exam, dated 01/23/09, this finding has not significantly changed.  However, there is considerable change in the appearance of the lung fields.  There are now bilateral pleural effusions, small on the right and moderate on the left with associated atelectasis.  There are also extensive right lung consolidations, all new or increased significantly from the prior examination.  Again identified is a somewhat spiculated region of increased density at the right lung apex, which may indicate fibrosis or scarring, but the possibility of primary or metastatic disease cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax in the interval.

On the mediastinal windows, there is presumed subcarinal adenopathy, with one lymph node measuring roughly 12 mm suggestive of metastatic disease here.  There is aortic root and arch and descending thoracic aortic calcification.  There are scattered regions of soft plaque intermixed with this.  The heart is not enlarged.  The left axilla is intact in regards to adenopathy.  The inferior thyroid appears unremarkable.

Limited assessment of the upper abdomen discloses a region of lower density within the right hepatic lobe, this finding is indeterminate, and if there is need for additional imaging in regards to hepatic metastatic disease, follow up ultrasound.  Spleen, adrenal glands, and upper kidneys appear unremarkable.  Visualized portions of the pancreas are unremarkable.

There is extensive rib destruction in the region of the chest wall mass.  There are changes suggesting prior trauma to the right clavicle.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Again demonstrated is a large right chest wall mass.
2.  No central embolus, distal subsegmental and segmental pulmonary artery branches are in part obscured by the pulmonary parenchymal findings, are not well assessed.
3.  New bilateral pleural effusions and extensive increasing consolidations and infiltrates in the right lung.
4.  See above regarding other findings.

EXAM:
MRI LEFT SHOULDER

CLINICAL:
This is a 51-year-old female with left shoulder pain and restricted external rotation and abduction x 6 months. Received for second opinion. Study performed on 10/04/05.

FINDINGS:

The patient was scanned in a 1.5 Tesla magnet.

There is a flat undersurface of the acromion (Type I) morphology, with anterior downsloping orientation.

There is inflammation of the anterior rotator interval capsule with peritendinous edema involving the intracapsular long biceps tendon best appreciated on the (axial gradient echo T2 series #3 images #6-9). There is edema with thickening of the superior glenohumeral ligament (axial T2 series #3 image #7). There is flattening of the long biceps tendon as it enters the bicipital groove (axial T2 series #3 image #9-10), but no subluxation. The findings suggest early changes of a hidden lesion.

Normal biceps labral complex and superior labrum, and there is no demonstrated superior labral tear.

There is minimal tendinitis with intratendinous edema of the insertion of the subscapularis tendon (axial T2 series #3 image #10). There is minimal fluid within the glenohumeral joint capsule within normal physiologic volume limits.

Normal anterior and posterior glenoid labra.

Normal supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons.

Normal muscles of the rotator cuff and there is no muscular atrophy.

There is minimal fluid loculated within the labral ligamentous capsular complex along the posterior-superior labrum (sagittal T2 series #7 image #5; coronal T2 series #5 image #7), but there is no demonstrated posterior-superior labral tear or paralabral cyst or ganglion.

Normal acromioclavicular articulation.

IMPRESSION:

Inflammation of the anterior rotator interval capsule with interstitial edema of the superior glenohumeral ligament.

Flattening of the long biceps tendon as it enters the bicipital groove, but no subluxation. Findings suggest early changes of a hidden lesion.

Mild tendinitis of the distal insertion of the subscapularis tendon, but no tendon tear.

Normal supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor tendons and muscular complexes.

Type I morphology with an anterior downsloping orientation of the acromion, but no inferior acromial osteophyte.

EXAM: 
 CT cervical spine.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 MVA, feeling sleepy, headache, shoulder and rib pain.

TECHNIQUE:
  Axial images through the cervical spine with coronal and sagittal reconstructions.

FINDINGS:
  There is reversal of the normal cervical curvature at the vertebral body heights.  The intervertebral disk spaces are otherwise maintained.  There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  The facets are aligned.  The tip of the clivus and occiput appear intact.  On the coronal reconstructed sequence, there is satisfactory alignment of C1 on C2, no evidence of a base of dens fracture.

The included portions of the first and second ribs are intact.  There is no evidence of a posterior element fracture.  Included portions of the mastoid air cells appear clear.  There is no CT evidence of a moderate or high-grade stenosis.

IMPRESSION: 
 No acute process, cervical spine.

EXAM:  
CT KUB.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Flank pain.

TECHNIQUE:
  Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis per renal stone protocol.

Correlation is made with the prior examination dated 01/16/09.

FINDINGS: 
 There is no intrarenal stone or obstruction bilaterally.  There is no hydronephrosis, ureteral dilatation.  There are calcifications about the pelvis including one in the left upper pelvis, but these are stable from the prior study and there is no upstream ureteral dilatation, the findings therefore are favored to represent phleboliths.  The bladder is nearly completely decompressed.  There is no asymmetric renal enlargement or perinephric stranding as secondary evidence of obstruction.

The appendix is normal.  There is no evidence for a pericolonic inflammatory process or small bowel obstruction.

Dedicated scan to the pelvis disclosed the aforementioned presumed phleboliths.  There is no pelvic free fluid or adenopathy.

Lung bases appear clear.  Given the lack of contrast, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas appear grossly unremarkable.  The gallbladder has been resected.  There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy.

IMPRESSION:

1. No renal stone or evidence of obstruction.  Stable appearing pelvic calcifications likely indicate phleboliths.
2. Normal appendix.

DIAGNOSIS:
  Possible cerebrovascular accident.

DESCRIPTION: 
 The EEG was obtained using 21 electrodes placed in scalp-to-scalp and scalp-to-vertex montages.  The background activity appears to consist of fairly organized somewhat pleomorphic low to occasional medium amplitude of 7-8 cycle per second activity and was seen mostly posteriorly bilaterally symmetrically.  A large amount of movement artifacts and electromyographic effects were noted intermixed throughout the recording session.  Transient periods of drowsiness occurred naturally producing irregular 5-7 cycle per second activity mostly over the anterior regions.  Hyperventilation was not performed.  No epileptiform activity or any definite lateralizing findings were seen.

IMPRESSION: 
 Mildly abnormal study.  The findings are suggestive of a generalized cerebral disorder.  Due to the abundant amount of movement artifacts, any lateralizing findings, if any cannot be well appreciated.  Clinical correlation is recommended.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 This is a 64-year-old male patient, who had a previous stress test, which was abnormal and hence has been referred for a stress test with imaging for further classification of coronary artery disease and ischemia.

PERTINENT MEDICATIONS:
  Include Tylenol, Robitussin, Colace, Fosamax, multivitamins, hydrochlorothiazide, Protonix and flaxseed oil.

With the patient at rest 10.5 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi was injected and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained.

PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION: 
 The patient exercised for a total of 4 minutes and 41 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol.  The peak workload was 7 METs.  The resting heart rate was 61 beats per minute and the peak heart rate was 173 beats per minute, which was 85% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate response.  The blood pressure response was normal with the resting blood pressure 126/86, and the peak blood pressure of 134/90.  EKG at rest showed normal sinus rhythm with a right-bundle branch block.  The peak stress EKG was abnormal with 2 mm of ST segment depression in V3 to V6, which remained abnormal till about 6 to 8 minutes into recovery.  There were occasional PVCs, but no sustained arrhythmia.  The patient had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia at peak stress.  The ischemic threshold was at a heart rate of 118 beats per minute and at 4.6 METs.  At peak stress, the patient was injected with 30.3 mCi of Cardiolite technetium-99 m sestamibi and myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained, and was compared to resting images.

MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:

1.  The overall quality of the scan was fair in view of increased abdominal uptake, increased bowel uptake seen.
2.  There was a large area of moderate to reduced tracer concentration seen in the inferior wall and the inferior apex.  This appeared to be partially reversible in the resting images.
3.  The left ventricle appeared normal in size.
4.  Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function with normal wall thickening.  The calculated ejection fraction was 70% at rest.

CONCLUSIONS:

1.  Average exercise tolerance.
2.  Adequate cardiac stress.
3.  Abnormal EKG response to stress, consistent with ischemia.  No symptoms of chest pain at rest.
4.  Myocardial perfusion imaging was abnormal with a large-sized, moderate intensity partially reversible inferior wall and inferior apical defect, consistent with inferior wall ischemia and inferior apical ischemia.
5.  The patient had run of SVT at peak stress.
6.  Gated SPECT images revealed normal wall motion and normal left ventricular systolic function.

EXAM: 
 CT head without contrast.

INDICATIONS: 
 Assaulted, positive loss of consciousness, rule out bleed.

TECHNIQUE: 
 CT examination of the head was performed without intravenous contrast administration.  There are no comparison studies.

FINDINGS:  
There are no abnormal extraaxial fluid collections.  There is no midline shift or mass effect.  Ventricular system demonstrates no dilatation.  There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.  The calvarium is intact.  There is a laceration in the left parietal region of the scalp without underlying calvarial fractures.  The mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:  
No acute intracranial process.

HISTORY: 
 The patient is a 34-year-old right-handed female who states her symptoms first started after a motor vehicle accident in September 2005.  She may have had a brief loss of consciousness at the time of the accident since shortly thereafter she had some blurred vision, which lasted about a week and then resolved.  Since that time she has had right low neck pain and left low back pain.  She has been extensively worked up and treated for this.  MRI of the C & T spine and LS spine has been normal.  She has improved significantly, but still complains of pain.  In June of this year she had different symptoms, which she feels are unrelated.  She had some chest pain and feeling of tightness in the left arm and leg and face.  By the next morning she had numbness around her lips on the left side and encompassing the whole left arm and leg.  Symptoms lasted for about two days and then resolved.  However, since that time she has had intermittent numbness in the left hand and leg.  The face numbness has completely resolved.  Symptoms are mild.  She denies any previous similar episodes.  She denies associated dizziness, vision changes incoordination, weakness, change in gait, or change in bowel or bladder function.  There is no associated headache.

Brief examination reveals normal motor examination with no pronator drift and no incoordination.  Normal gait.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Sensory examination reveals normal facial sensation.  She has normal and symmetrical light touch, temperature, and pinprick in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities she has a feeling of dysesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left calf into the lateral aspect of the left foot.  In this area she has normal light touch and pinprick.  She describes it as a strange unusual sensation.

NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: 
 Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the left arm and leg.

NEEDLE EMG: 
 Needle EMG was performed in the left leg, lumbosacral paraspinal, right tibialis anterior, and right upper thoracic paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It revealed normal insertional activity, no spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit action potential form in all muscles tested.

IMPRESSION: 
 This electrical study is normal.  There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, plexopathy, or lumbosacral radiculopathy.  EMG was also performed in the right upper thoracic paraspinal where she has experienced a lot of pain since the motor vehicle accident.  This was normal.

Based on her history of sudden onset of left face, arm, and leg weakness as well as a normal EMG and MRI of her spine I am concerned that she had a central event in June of this year.  Symptoms are now very mild, but I have ordered an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and MRA of the head and neck with contrast to further elucidate her symptoms.  Once she has the test done she will phone me and further management will be based on the results.

CC:
 Left-sided weakness.

HX:
 This 28y/o RHM was admitted to a local hospital on 6/30/95 for a 7 day history of fevers, chills, diaphoresis, anorexia, urinary frequency, myalgias and generalized weakness. He denied foreign travel, IV drug abuse, homosexuality, recent dental work, or open wound. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Staphylococcus Aureus, oxacillin sensitive. He was place on appropriate antibiotic therapy according to sensitivity.. A 7/3/95 transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function and a damaged mitral valve with regurgitation. Later that day he developed left-sided weakness and severe dysarthria and aphasia. HCT, on 7/3/95 revealed mild attenuated signal in the right hemisphere. On 7/4/95 he developed first degree AV block, and was transferred to UIHC.

MEDS: 
Nafcillin 2gm IV q4hrs, Rifampin 600mg q12hrs, Gentamicin 130mg q12hrs.

PMH:
 1) Heart murmur dx age 5 years.

FHX:
 Unremarkable.

SHX:
 Employed cook. Denied ETOH/Tobacco/illicit drug use.

EXAM:
 BP 123/54, HR 117, RR 16, 37.0C

MS: Somnolent and arousable only by shaking and repetitive verbal commands. He could follow simple commands only. He nodded appropriately to questioning most of the time. Dysarthric speech with sparse verbal output.

CN: Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Conjugate gaze preference toward the right. Right hemianopia by visual threat testing. Optic discs flat and no retinal hemorrhages or Roth spots were seen. Left lower facial weakness. Tongue deviated to the left. Weak gag response, bilaterally. Weak left corneal response.

MOTOR: Dense left flaccid hemiplegia.

SENSORY: Less responsive to PP on left.

COORD: Unable to test.

Station and Gait: Not tested.

Reflexes: 2/3 throughout (more brisk on the left side). Left ankle clonus and a Left Babinski sign were present.

GEN EXAM: Holosystolic murmur heard throughout the precordium. Janeway lesions were present in the feet and hands. No Osler's nodes were seen.

COURSE:
 7/6/95, HCT showed a large RMCA stroke with mass shift. His neurologic exam worsened and he was intubated, hyperventilated, and given IV Mannitol. He then underwent emergent left craniectomy and duraplasty. He tolerated the procedure well and his brain was allowed to swell. He then underwent mitral valve replacement on 7/11/95 with a St. Judes valve. His post-operative recovery was complicated by pneumonia, pericardial effusion and dysphagia. He required temporary PEG placement for feeding. The 7/27/95, 8/6/95 and 10/18/96 HCT scans show the chronologic neuroradiologic documentation of a large RMCA stroke. His 10/18/96 Neurosurgery Clinic visit noted that he can ambulate without assistance with the use of a leg brace to prevent left foot drop. His proximal LLE strength was rated at a 4. His LUE was plegic. He had a seizure 6 days prior to his 10/18/96 evaluation. This began as a Jacksonian march of shaking in the LUE; then involved the LLE. There was no LOC or tongue-biting. He did have urinary incontinence. He was placed on DPH. His speech was dysarthric but fluent. He appeared bright, alert and oriented in all spheres.
        COMMENTS:
1.  The left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness appear normal.  The wall motion and left ventricular systolic function appears hyperdynamic with estimated ejection fraction of 70% to 75%.  There is near-cavity obliteration seen.  There also appears to be increased left ventricular outflow tract gradient at the mid cavity level consistent with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.  There is abnormal left ventricular relaxation pattern seen as well as elevated left atrial pressures seen by Doppler examination.
2.  The left atrium appears mildly dilated.
3.  The right atrium and right ventricle appear normal.
4.  The aortic root appears normal.
5.  The aortic valve appears calcified with mild aortic valve stenosis, calculated aortic valve area is 1.3 cm square with a maximum instantaneous gradient of 34 and a mean gradient of 19 mm.
6.  There is mitral annular calcification extending to leaflets and supportive structures with thickening of mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation.
7.  The tricuspid valve appears normal with trace tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.  Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 49 mmHg.  Estimated right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg.
8.  The pulmonary valve appears normal with trace pulmonary insufficiency.
9.  There is no pericardial effusion or intracardiac mass seen.
10.  There is a color Doppler suggestive of a patent foramen ovale with lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.
11.  The study was somewhat technically limited and hence subtle abnormalities could be missed from the study.


REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Pregnant female with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

FINDINGS: 
 The uterus measures 8.6 x 4.4 x 5.4 cm and contains a gestational sac with double decidual sac sign.  A yolk sac is visualized.  What appears to represent a crown-rump length measures 3.3 mm for an estimated sonographic age of 6 weeks 0 days and estimated date of delivery of 09/28/09.

Please note however that no fetal heart tones are seen.  However, fetal heart tones would be expected at this age.

The right ovary measures 3.1 x 1.6 x 2.3 cm.  The left ovary measures 3.3 x 1.9 x 3.5 cm.  No free fluid is detected.

IMPRESSION: 
 Single intrauterine pregnancy at 6 weeks 0 days with an estimated date of delivery of 09/28/09.  A live intrauterine pregnancy, however, could not be confirmed, as a sonographic fetal heart rate would be expected at this time.  A close interval followup in correlation with beta-hCG is necessary as findings may represent an inevitable abortion.

EXAM: 
 CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast.

HISTORY: 
 Lower abdominal pain.

FINDINGS:
  Limited views of the lung bases demonstrate linear density most likely representing dependent atelectasis.  There is a 1.6 cm nodular density at the left posterior sulcus.

Noncontrast technique limits evaluation of the solid abdominal organs.  Cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic calcifications are seen.

Hepatomegaly is observed.  There is calcification within the right lobe of the liver likely related to granulomatous changes.  Subtle irregularity of the liver contour is noted, suggestive of cirrhosis.  There is splenomegaly seen.  There are two low-attenuation lesions seen in the posterior aspect of the spleen, which are incompletely characterized that may represent splenic cyst.  The pancreas appears atrophic.  There is a left renal nodule seen, which measures 1.9 cm with a Hounsfield unit density of approximately 29, which is indeterminate.

There is mild bilateral perinephric stranding.  There is an 8-mm fat density lesion in the anterior inner polar region of the left kidney, compatible in appearance with angiomyolipoma.  There is a 1-cm low-attenuation lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney, likely representing a cyst, but incompletely characterized on this examination.  Bilateral ureters appear normal in caliber along their visualized course.  The bladder is partially distended with urine, but otherwise unremarkable.

Postsurgical changes of hysterectomy are noted.  There are pelvic phlebolith seen.  There is a calcified soft tissue density lesion in the right pelvis, which may represent an ovary with calcification, as it appears continuous with the right gonadal vein.

Scattered colonic diverticula are observed.  The appendix is within normal limits.  The small bowel is unremarkable.  There is an anterior abdominal wall hernia noted containing herniated mesenteric fat.  The hernia neck measures approximately 2.7 cm.  There is stranding of the fat within the hernia sac.

There are extensive degenerative changes of the right hip noted with changes suggestive of avascular necrosis.  Degenerative changes of the spine are observed.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Anterior abdominal wall hernia with mesenteric fat-containing stranding, suggestive of incarcerated fat.
2.  Nodule in the left lower lobe, recommend follow up in 3 months.
3.  Indeterminate left adrenal nodule, could be further assessed with dedicated adrenal protocol CT or MRI.
4.  Hepatomegaly with changes suggestive of cirrhosis.  There is also splenomegaly observed.
5.  Low-attenuation lesions in the spleen may represent cyst, that are incompletely characterized on this examination.
6.  Fat density lesion in the left kidney, likely represents angiomyolipoma.
7.  Fat density soft tissue lesion in the region of the right adnexa, this contains calcifications and may represent an ovary or possibly dermoid cyst.

EXAM:
  Ultrasound-guided paracentesis

HISTORY: 
 Ascites.

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  
Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were thoroughly explained.  Ultrasound demonstrates free fluid in the abdomen.  The area of interest was localized with ultrasonography.  The region was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Local anesthetic was administered.  A 5-French Yueh catheter needle combination was taken.  Upon crossing into the peritoneal space and aspiration of fluid, the catheter was advanced out over the needle.  A total of approximately 5500 mL of serous fluid was obtained.  The catheter was then removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedure complications.

IMPRESSION: 
 Ultrasound-guided paracentesis as above.

CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Evaluate for retroperitoneal hematoma, the patient has been following, is currently on Coumadin.

CT ABDOMEN: 
 There is no evidence for a retroperitoneal hematoma.

The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are unremarkable.  Within the superior pole of the left kidney, there is a 3.9 cm cystic lesion.  A 3.3 cm cystic lesion is also seen within the inferior pole of the left kidney.  No calcifications are noted.  The kidneys are small bilaterally.

CT PELVIS: 
 Evaluation of the bladder is limited due to the presence of a Foley catheter, the bladder is nondistended.  The large and small bowels are normal in course and caliber.  There is no obstruction.

Bibasilar pleural effusions are noted.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence for retroperitoneal bleed.
2. There are two left-sided cystic lesions within the kidney, correlation with a postcontrast study versus further characterization with an ultrasound is advised as the cystic lesions appear slightly larger as compared to the prior exam.
3. The kidneys are small in size bilaterally.
4. Bibasilar pleural effusions.

EXAM:
MRI LEFT FOOT

CLINICAL:
 A 49-year-old female with ankle pain times one month, without a specific injury. Patient complains of moderate to severe pain, worse with standing or walking on hard surfaces, with tenderness to palpation at the plantar aspect of the foot and midfoot region and tenderness over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon.

FINDINGS:

Received for second opinion interpretations is an MRI examination performed on 05/27/2005.

There is edema of the subcutis adipose space extending along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle.

There is edema of the subcutis adipose space posterior to the Achilles tendon. Findings suggest altered biomechanics with crural fascial strains.

There is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus with mild tendon thickening. There is possible partial surface tearing of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus (axial inversion recovery image #16) which is a possible hypertrophic tear less than 50% in cross sectional diameter. The study has been performed with the foot in neutral position. Confirmation of this possible partial tendon tear would require additional imaging with the foot in a plantar flexed position with transaxial images of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus oriented perpendicular to the course of the posterior tibialis tendon.

There is minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths consistent with flexor splinting but intrinsically normal tendons.

Normal peroneal tendons.

There is tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with thickening but no demonstrated tendon tear. Normal extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum tendons.

Normal Achilles tendon. There is a low-lying soleus muscle that extends to within 2cm of the teno-osseous insertion of the Achilles tendon.

Normal distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex.

Normal lateral, subtalar and deltoid ligamentous complexes.

There are no erosions of the inferior neck of the talus and there are no secondary findings of a midfoot pronating force.

Normal plantar fascia. There is no plantar calcaneal spur.

There is venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot extending along the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves which may be acting as intermittent entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves.

Normal tibiotalar, subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations.

The metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux was partially excluded from the field-of-view of this examination.

IMPRESSION:

Tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon with tendon thickening and possible surface fraying / tearing of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus, however, confirmation of this finding would require additional imaging.

Minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths, consistent with flexor splinting.

Edema of the subcutis adipose space along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle suggesting altered biomechanics and crural fascial strain.

Mild tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with mild tendon thickening.

Normal plantar fascia and no plantar fasciitis.

Venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot which may be acting as entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves.

EXAM: 
 Ultrasound Abdomen.
REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Elevated liver function tests.
INTERPRETATION: 
 The liver demonstrates heterogeneously increased echotexture with significant fatty infiltration.  The gallbladder is surgically absent. There is no fluid collection in the cholecystectomy bed.  There is dilatation of the common bile duct up to 1 cm.  There is also dilatation of the pancreatic duct that measures up to 3 mm.  There is caliectasis in the right kidney.  The bladder is significantly distended measuring 937 cc in volume.  The caliectasis in the right kidney may be secondary to back pressure from the distended bladder.  The aorta is normal in caliber.
IMPRESSION:

1.  Dilated common duct as well as pancreatic duct as described.  Given the dilatation of these two ducts, ERCP versus MRCP is recommended to exclude obstructing mass.  The findings could reflect changes of cholecystectomy.  
2.  Significantly distended bladder with probably resultant caliectasis in the right kidney.  Clinical correlation recommended.

CC:
 Headache.

HX:
 63 y/o RHF first seen by Neurology on 9/14/71 for complaint of episodic vertigo. During that evaluation she described a several year history of &quot;migraine&quot; headaches. She experienced her first episode of vertigo in 1969. The vertigo (clockwise) typically began suddenly after lying down, and was not associated with nausea/vomiting/headache. The vertigo had not been consistently associated with positional change and could last hours to days.

On 3/15/71, after 5 day bout of vertigo, right ear ache, and difficulty ambulating (secondary to the vertigo) she sought medical attention and underwent an audiogram which reportedly showed a 20% decline in low tone acuity AD. She complained of associated tinnitus which she described as a &quot;whistle.&quot; In addition, her symptoms appeared to worsen with changes in head position (i.e. looking up or down). The symptoms gradually resolved and she did well until 8/71 when she experienced a 19-day episode of vertigo, tinnitus and intermittent headaches. She was seen 9/14/71, in Neurology, and admitted for evaluation.

Her neurologic exam at that time was unremarkable except for prominent bilateral systolic carotid bruits. Cerebral angiogram revealed an inoperable 7 x 6cm AVM in the right parietal region. The AVM was primarily fed by the right MCA. Otolaryngologic evaluation concluded that she probably also suffered from Meniere's disease.

On 10/14/74 she underwent a 21 day admission for SAH secondary to right parietal AVM.

On 11/23/91 she was admitted for left sided weakness (LUE &gt; LLE), headache, and transient visual change. Neurological exam confirmed left sided weakness, and dysesthesia of the LUE only. Brain CT confirmed a 3 x 4 cm left parietal hemorrhage. She underwent unsuccessful embolization. Neuroradiology had planned to do 3 separate embolizations, but during the first, via the left MCA, they were unable to cannulate many of the AVM vessels and abandoned the procedure. She recovered with residual left hemisensory loss.

In 12/92 she presented with an interventricular hemorrhage and was managed conservatively and refused any future neuroradiologic intervention.

In 1/93 she reconsidered neurointerventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ.

CC:
 Difficulty with word finding.

HX: 
This 27y/o RHF experienced sudden onset word finding difficulty and slurred speech on the evening of 2/19/96. She denied any associated dysphagia, diplopia, numbness or weakness of her extremities. She went to sleep with her symptoms on 2/19/96, and awoke with them on 2/20/96. She also awoke with a headache (HA) and mild neck stiffness. She took a shower and her HA and neck stiffness resolved. Throughout the day she continued to have difficulty with word finding and had worsening of her slurred speech. That evening, she began to experience numbness and weakness in the lower right face. She felt like there was a &quot;rubber-band&quot; wrapped around her tongue.

For 3 weeks prior to presentation, she experienced transient episodes of a &quot;boomerang&quot; shaped field cut in the left eye. The episodes were not associated with any other symptoms. One week prior to presentation, she went to a local ER for menorrhagia. She had just resumed taking oral birth control pills one week prior to the ER visit after having stopped their use for several months. Local evaluation included an unremarkable carotid duplex scan. However, a HCT with and without contrast reportedly revealed a left frontal gyriform enhancing lesion. An MRI brain scan on 2/20/96 revealed nonspecific white matter changes in the right periventricular region. EEG reportedly showed diffuse slowing. CRP was reportedly &quot;too high&quot; to calibrate.

EXAM: 
BP150/79, HR77, RR22, 37.4C.

MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was dysarthric with mild decreased fluency marked by occasional phonemic paraphasic errors. Comprehension, naming and reading were intact. She was able to repeat, though her repetition was occasionally marked by phonemic paraphasic errors. She had no difficulty with calculation.

CN: VFFTC, Pupils 5/5 decreasing to 3/3. EOM intact. No papilledema or hemorrhages seen on fundoscopy. No RAPD or INO. There was right lower facial weakness. Facial sensation was intact, bilaterally. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.

MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone.

Sensory: No deficits.

Coord/Station/Gait: unremarkable.

Reflexes 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.

Gen Exam: unremarkable.

COURSE:
 CRP 1.2 (elevated), ESR 10, RF 20, ANA 1:40, ANCA &lt;1:40, TSH 2.0, FT4 1.73, Anticardiolipin antibody IgM 10.8GPL units (normal &lt;10.9), Anticardiolipin antibody IgG 14.8GPL (normal&lt;22.9), SSA and SSB were normal. Urine beta-hCG pregnancy and drug screen were negative. EKG, CXR and UA were negative.

MRI brain, 2/21/96 revealed increased signal on T2 imaging in the periventricular white matter region of the right hemisphere. In addition, there were subtle T2 signal changes in the right frontal, right parietal, and left parietal regions as seen previously on her local MRI can. In addition, special FLAIR imaging showed increased signal in the right frontal region consistent with ischemia.

She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 2/22/96. This revealed decreased flow and vessel narrowing the candelabra branches of the RMCA supplying the right frontal lobe. These changes corresponded to the areas of ischemic changes seen on MRI. There was also segmental narrowing of the caliber of the vessels in the circle of Willis. There was a small aneurysm at the origin of the LPCA. There was narrowing in the supraclinoid portion of the RICA and the proximal M1 and A1 segments. The study was highly suggestive of vasculitis.

2/23/96, Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed no evidence of retinal vasculitic change. Neuropsychologic testing the same day revealed slight impairment of complex attention only. She was started on Prednisone 60mg qd and Tagamet 400mg qhs.

On 2/26/96, she underwent a right frontal brain biopsy. Pathologic evaluation revealed evidence of focal necrosis (stroke/infarct), but no evidence of vasculitis. Immediately following the brain biopsy, while still in the recovery room, she experienced sudden onset right hemiparesis and transcortical motor type aphasia. Initial HCT was unremarkable. An EEG was consistent with a focal lesion in the left hemisphere. However, a 2/28/96 MRI brain scan revealed new increased signal on T2 weighted images in a gyriform pattern from the left precentral gyrus to the superior frontal gyrus. This was felt consistent with vasculitis.

She began q2month cycles of Cytoxan (1,575mg IV on 2/29/96. She became pregnant after her 4th cycle of Cytoxan, despite warnings to the contrary. After extensive discussions with OB/GYN it was recommended she abort the pregnancy. She underwent neuropsychologic testing which revealed no significant cognitive deficits. She later agreed to the abortion. She has undergone 9 cycles of Cytoxan ( one cycle every 2 months) as of 4/97. She had complained of one episode of paresthesias of the LUE in 1/97. MRI then showed no new signs ischemia.

HISTORY: 
 The patient is a 52-year-old right-handed female with longstanding bilateral arm pain, which is predominantly in the medial aspect of her arms and hands as well as left hand numbness, worse at night and after doing repetitive work with her left hand.  She denies any weakness.  No significant neck pain, change in bowel or bladder symptoms, change in gait, or similar symptoms in the past.  She is on Lyrica for the pain, which has been somewhat successful.

Examination reveals positive Phalen's test on the left.  Remainder of her neurological examination is normal.

NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:  
The left median motor distal latency is prolonged with normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity.  The left median sensory distal latency is prolonged with an attenuated evoked response amplitude.  The right median sensory distal latency is mildly prolonged with a mildly attenuated evoked response amplitude.  The right median motor distal latency and evoked response amplitude is normal.  Left ulnar motor and sensory and left radial sensory responses are normal.  Left median F-wave is normal.

NEEDLE EMG:
  Needle EMG was performed on the left arm, right first dorsal interosseous muscle, and bilateral cervical paraspinal muscles.  It revealed spontaneous activity in the left abductor pollicis brevis muscle.  There is increased insertional activity in the right first dorsal interosseous muscle.  Both interosseous muscles showed signs of reinnervation.  Left extensor digitorum communis muscle showed evidence of reduced recruitment.  Cervical paraspinal muscles were normal.

IMPRESSION: 
 This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:  A left median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.  Electrical abnormalities are moderate-to-mild bilateral C8 radiculopathies.  This may be an incidental finding.

I have recommended MRI of the spine without contrast and report will be sent to Dr. XYZ.  She will follow up with Dr. XYZ with respect to treatment of the above conditions.

 This 77 y/o RHF presented with a one year history of progressive memory loss. Two weeks prior to her evaluation at UIHC she agreed to have her sister pick her up for church at 8:15AM, Sunday morning. That Sunday she went to pick up her sister at her sister's home and when her sister was not there (because the sister had gone to pick up the patient) the patient left. She later called the sister and asked her if she (sister) had overslept. During her UIHC evaluation she denied she knew anything about the incident. No other complaints were brought forth by the patients family.

Visual memory, including immediate and delayed recall was also severely impaired. Visuoperceptual discrimination was mildly impaired, as was 2-D constructional praxis.

HCT, 12/7/92: 
 Diffuse cerebral atrophy with associative mild enlargement of the ventricles consistent with patient's age. Calcification is seen in both globus pallidi and this was felt to be a normal variant.

CC:
 Progressive lower extremity weakness.

HX: 
This 54 y/o RHF presented on 7/3/93 with a 2 month history of lower extremity weakness. She was admitted to a local hospital on 5/3/93 for a 3 day h/o of progressive BLE weakness associated with incontinence and BLE numbness. There was little symptom of upper extremity weakness at that time, according to the patient. Her evaluation was notable for a bilateral L1 sensory level and 4/4 strength in BLE. A T-L-S Spine MRI revealed a T4-6 lipomatosis with anterior displacement of the cord without cord compression. CSF analysis yielded: opening pressure of 14cm H20, protein 88, glucose 78, 3 lymphocytes and 160 RBC, no oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index, and negative cytology. Bone marrow biopsy was negative. B12, Folate, and Ferritin levels were normal. CRP 5.2 (elevated). ANA was positive at 1:5,120 in speckled pattern. Her hospital course was complicated by deep venous thrombosis, which recurred after heparin was stopped to do the bone marrow biopsy. She was subsequently placed on Coumadin. EMG/NCV testing revealed &quot; lumbosacral polyradiculopathy with axonal degeneration and nerve conduction block.&quot; She was diagnosed with atypical Guillain-Barre vs. polyradiculopathy and received a single course of Decadron; and no plasmapheresis or IV IgG. She was discharged home o 6/8/93.

She subsequently did not improve and after awaking from a nap on her couch the day of presentation, 7/3/93, she found she was paralyzed from the waist down. There was associated mild upper lumbar back pain without radiation. She had had no bowel movement or urination since that time. She had no recent trauma, fever, chills, changes in vision, dysphagia or upper extremity deficit.

RECTAL: 
Poor rectal tone. stool guaiac negative. She had no perirectal sensation.

COURSE:
 CRP 8.8 and ESR 76. FVC 2.17L. WBC 1.5 (150 bands, 555 neutrophils, 440 lymphocytes and 330 monocytes), Hct 33%, Hgb 11.0, Plt 220K, MCV 88, GS normal except for slightly low total protein (8.0). LFT were normal. Creatinine 1.0. PT and PTT were normal. ABCG 7.46/25/79/96% O2Sat. UA notable for 1+ proteinuria. EKG normal.

MRI L-spine, 7/3/93, revealed an area of abnormally increased T2 signal extending from T12 through L5. This area causes anterior displacement of the spinal cord and nerve roots. The cauda equina are pushed up against the posterior L1 vertebral body. There bilaterally pulmonary effusions. There is also abnormally increased T2 signal in the center of the spinal cord extending from the mid thoracic level through the conus. In addition, the Fila Terminale appear thickened. There is increased signal in the T3 vertebral body suggestion a hemangioma. The findings were felt consistent with a large epidural lipoma displacing the spinal cord anteriorly. there also appeared spinal cord swelling and increased signal within the spinal cord which suggests an intramedullary process.

CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,342, glucose 43, RBC 4,900, WBC 9. C3 and C$ complement levels were 94 and 18 respectively (normal) Anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. Serum Beta-2 microglobulin was elevated at 2.4 and 3.7 in the CSF and Serum, respectively. It was felt the patient had either a transverse myelitis associated with SLE vs. partial cord infarction related to lupus vasculopathy or hypercoagulable state. She was place on IV Decadron. Rheumatology felt that a diagnosis of SLE was likely. Pulmonary effusion analysis was consistent with an exudate. She was treated with plasma exchange and place on Cytoxan.

On 7/22/93 she developed fever with associated proptosis and sudden loss of vision, OD. MRI Brain, 7/22/93, revealed a 5mm thick area of intermediate signal adjacent to the posterior aspect of the right globe, possibly representing hematoma. Ophthalmology felt she had a central retinal vein occlusion; and it was surgically decompressed.

She was placed on prednisone on 8/11/93 and Cytoxan was started on 8/16/93. She developed a headache with meningismus on 8/20/93. CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,002, glucose2, WBC 8,925 (majority were neutrophils). Sinus CT scan negative. She was placed on IV Antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis. Cultures were subsequently negative. She spontaneously recovered. 8/25/93, cisternal tap CSF analysis revealed: protein 126, glucose 35, WBC 144 (neutrophils), RBC 95, Cultures negative, cytology negative. MRI Brain scan revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement in both brain and spinal canal.

DSDNA negative. She developed leukopenia in 9/93, and she was switched from Cytoxan to Imuran. Her LFT's rose and the Imuran was stopped and she was placed back on prednisone.

She went on to have numerous deep venous thrombosis while on Coumadin. This required numerous hospital admissions for heparinization. Anticardiolipin antibodies and Protein C and S testing was negative.
        This is a 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY: 
 The patient was recorded from 2:15 p.m. on 08/21/06 through 1:55 p.m. on 08/25/06.  The patient was recorded digitally using the 10-20 system of electrode placement.  Additional temporal electrodes and single channels of EOG and EKG were also recorded.  The patient's medications valproic acid, Zonegran, and Keppra were weaned progressively throughout the study.

The occipital dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 Hz and well regulated.  Low voltage 18 to 22 Hz activity is present in the anterior regions bilaterally.

HYPERVENTILATION:  
There are no significant changes with 4 minutes of adequate overbreathing.

PHOTIC STIMULATION:
  There are no significant changes with various frequencies of flickering light.

SLEEP: 
 There are no focal or lateralizing features and no abnormal waveforms.

INDUCED EVENT: 
 On the final day of study, a placebo induction procedure was performed to induce a clinical event.  The patient was informed that we would be doing prolonged photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which might induce a seizure.  At 1:38 p.m., the patient was instructed to begin hyperventilation.  Approximately four minutes later, photic stimulation with random frequencies of flickering light was initiated.  Approximately 8 minutes into the procedure, the patient became unresponsive to verbal questioning.  Approximately 1 minute later, she began to exhibit asynchronous shaking of her upper and lower extremities with her eyes closed.  She persisted with the shaking and some side-to-side movements of her head for approximately 1 minute before abruptly stopping.  Approximately 30 seconds later, she became slowly responsive initially only uttering a few words and able to say her name.  When asked what had just occurred, she replied that she was asleep and did not remember any event.  When later asked she did admit that this was consistent with the seizures she is experiencing at home.

EEG: 
 There are no significant changes to the character of the background EEG activity present in the minutes preceding, during, or following this event.  Of note, while her eyes were closed and she was non-responsive, there is a well-regulated occipital dominant rhythm present.

IMPRESSION:
  The findings of this patient's 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study are within the range of normal variation.  No epileptiform activity is present.  One clinical event was induced with hyperventilation and photic stimulation.  The clinical features of this event are described in the technical summary above.  There was no epileptiform activity associated with this event.  This finding is consistent with a non-epileptic pseudoseizure.

IMPRESSION: 
 Nerve conduction screen demonstrates borderline median sensory and borderline distal median motor responses in both hands.  There is borderline evidence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  The sensory and motor responses are noted to be attenuated in both upper extremities.

The needle EMG examination is remarkable for rather diffuse active denervation changes in most muscles of the right upper and right lower extremity tested and there is active denervation in several muscles of the left arm and left leg as well.  The diffuse nature of the active denervation changes in multiple myotomes of both upper and lower extremities suggests the possibility of motor neuron disease.  Other neuropathic conditions, polymyositis, etc., need to be considered in differential diagnosis.

EXAM: 
 Cervical, lumbosacral, thoracic spine flexion and extension.

HISTORY: 
 Back and neck pain.

CERVICAL SPINE

FINDINGS:  
AP, lateral with flexion and extension, and both oblique projections of the cervical spine demonstrate alignment and soft tissue structures to be unremarkable.   The vertebral bodies and the disc spaces appear normal.   Oblique views demonstrate the intervertebral foramina to be of normal size and appearance.  The odontoid view demonstrates the C1-2 structures to be in anatomical alignment.   Additional flexion and extension views in the lateral position demonstrate normal physiologic movement with no evidence of subluxation or fixation. 

IMPRESSION:  
Negative cervical spine study including flexion-extension views.

THORACIC SPINE

FINDINGS: 
 AP and lateral views of the thoracic spine, including a &quot;swimmer's&quot; projection for the upper thoracic spine, demonstrate satisfactory bony alignment. There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc spaces.  No fractures or loss of normal bony architecture is seen.  No paravertebral masses are identified.

IMPRESSION: 
 Negative thoracic spine.

LUMBAR SPINE

FINDINGS: 
 Frontal and lateral views of the lumbar spine demonstrate satisfactory bony alignment with no fractures or loss of normal bony architecture.   There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc spaces.   No paravertebral masses are evident.   There is no fracture.

        A 62-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and implanted defibrillator.

COMPARISON STUDIES:
 None.

MEDICATION: 
  Lopressor 5 mg IV.

HEART RATE AFTER MEDICATION:
 64bpm

EXAM:
TECHNIQUE: Tomographic images were obtained of the heart and chest with a 64 detector row scanner using slice thicknesses of less than 1 mm. 80cc of Isovue 370 was injected in the right arm.

TECHNICAL QUALITY:

Examination is limited secondary to extensive artifact from defibrillator wires.

There is good demonstration of the coronary arteries and there is good bolus timing.

FINDINGS:

LEFT MAIN CORONARY ARTERY:

The left main coronary artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a normal ostium. There is no calcific or non-calcific plaque. The vessel bifurcates into a left anterior descending artery and a left circumflex artery.

LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY:

The left anterior descending artery is a moderate-sized vessel, with a small first diagonal branch and a large second diagonal branch. The vessel continues as a small vessel, tapering at the apex of the left ventricle. There is calcific plaque within the mid vessel, with dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the second diagonal branch. This limits evaluation of the vessel lumen, and although a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded, there is no evidence of a high-grade stenosis. There is ostial calcification within the second diagonal branch as well. The LAD distal to the second diagonal branch is small relative to the more proximal vessel, and this is worrisome for a proximal flow-limiting lesion.

In addition, there is marked tapering of the D2 branch distal to the proximal and ostial calcific plaque. This is worrisome for either occlusion or a high-grade stenosis. There is only minimal contrast that is identified in the distal vessel.

LEFT CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY:

The left circumflex artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a patent ostium. There is calcific plaque within the proximal vessel. There is dense calcific plaque at the bifurcation of the OM1, and the AV groove branch. The AV groove branch tapers as a small vessel at the base of the heart. The dense calcific plaque within the bifurcation of the OM1 and the AV groove branch limits evaluation of the vessel lumen. There is no demonstrated high-grade stenosis, but a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here.

RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:

The right coronary artery is a moderate-sized vessel with a patent ostium. There is proximal mixed calcific and non-calcific plaque, but there is no flow-limiting lesion. The vessel continues as a moderate-sized vessel to the crux of the heart, supplying a small posterior descending artery and moderate to large posterolateral ventricular branches.

There is scattered calcific plaque within the mid vessel and there is also calcific plaque within the distal vessel at the origin of the posterior descending artery. There is no flow-limited lesion demonstrated.

The right coronary artery is dominant.

NONCORONARY CARDIAC STRUCTURE:

CARDIAC CHAMBERS:
 There is diffuse myocardial thinning within the left ventricle, particularly within the apex where there is subendocardial calcification, consistent with chronic infarction. There is ventricular enlargement. There is no demonstrated aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm.

CARDIAC VALVES: 
There is calcification within the left aortic valve cusp. The aortic valve is tri-leaflet. Normal mitral valve.

PERICARDIUM:
 Normal.

GREAT VESSELS: 
There are atherosclerotic changes within the aorta.

VISUALIZED LUNG PARENCHYMA, MEDIASTINUM AND CHEST WALL: 
Normal.

IMPRESSION:

Limited examination secondary to extensive artifact from the pacemaker wires.

There is extensive calcific plaque within the left anterior descending artery as well as within the proximal second diagonal branch. There is marked tapering of the LAD distal to the bifurcation of the D1 and this is worrisome for a flow-limiting lesion, but there is no evidence of occlusion.

There is marked tapering of the D1 branch distal to the calcific plaque and occlusion cannot be excluded.

There is dense calcific plaque within the left circumflex artery, and although a flow-limiting lesion cannot be excluded here, there is no evidence of an occlusion or high-grade stenosis.

There is mixed soft and calcific plaque within the proximal RCA, but there is no flow limiting lesion demonstrated.

There is diffuse thinning of the left ventricular wall, most focal at the apex where there is also dense calcification, consistent with chronic infarction. There is no demonstrated aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm.

Paraplegia.

HX:
 This 32 y/o RHF had been performing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years and delivered her 4th child by vaginal delivery on 4/10/97. The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time.

On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb.

She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with &quot;pins & needles&quot; sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in. During the one hour flight her BLE weakness progressed to a non-weight bearing state (i.e. she could not stand). Local evaluation revealed 3/3 proximal and 4/4 distal BLE weakness. She had a sensory level to her waist on PP and LT testing. She also had mild lumbar back pain. Local laboratory evaluation: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was presumed to have Guillain-Barre syndrome and was placed on Solu-Cortef 1000mg qd and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g.

On 5/10/97, she was airlifted to Geneva, Switzerland. Upon arrival there she had total anesthesia from the feet up to the inguinal region, bilaterally. There was flaccid areflexic paralysis of BLE and she was unable to void or defecate. Straight catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 1000cc. On 5/12/ CSF analysis revealed: Protein 1.5g/l, Glucose 2.2mmol/l, WBC 92 (O PMNS, 100% Lymphocytes), RBC 70, Clear CSF, bacterial-fungal-AFB-cultures were negative. Broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd were started. MRI T-L-spine, 5/12/97 revealed an intradural T12-L1 lesion that enhanced minimally with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord edema in the affected area. MRI Brain, 5/12/97, was unremarkable and showed no evidence of demyelinating disease. HIV, HTLV-1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, Malaria and CMV serological titers were negative. On 5/15/97 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serological titer returned positive at 1:320 (normal&lt;1:80). 5/12/97 CSF Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT and ELISA were negative. She was then given a one day course of Praziquantel 3.6g total in 3 doses; and started on Prednisone 60 mg po qd; the broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol were discontinued.

On 5/22/97, a rectal biopsy was performed to evaluate parasite eradication. The result came back positive for ova and granulomata after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. 5/22/97 CSF schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were positive at 1.09 and 1:160, respectively. These titers were not known when she initially arrived at UIHC.

Following administration of Praziquantel, she regained some sensation in BLE but the paraplegia, and urinary retention remained.

COURSE:
 MRI T-L-spine, 5/24/97, revealed a 6 x 8 x 25 soft tissue mass at the L1 level posterior to the tip of the conus medullaris and extending into the canal below that level. This appeared to be intradural. There was mild enhancement. There was more enhancement along the distal cord surface and cauda equina. The distal cord had sign of diffuse edema. She underwent exploratory and decompressive laminectomy on 5/27/97, and was retreated with a one day course of Praziquantel 40mg/kg/day. Praziquantel is reportedly only 80% effective at parasite eradication.

She continued to reside on the Neurology/Neurosurgical service on 5/31/97 and remained paraplegic.

CC:
 Horizontal diplopia.

HX: 
 This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia.

Motor: 5/5 full strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone.

Sensory: unremarkable.

Coord: mild &quot;ataxia&quot; of RAM (left &gt; right)

Station: no pronator drift or Romberg sign

Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 symmetric throughout. Plantars (bilateral dorsiflexion)

STUDIES/COURSE:
 Gen Screen: unremarkable. Brain CT revealed 1.0 x 1.5 cm area of calcific density within the medial two-thirds of the left cerebral peduncle. This shows no mass effect, but demonstrates mild contrast enhancement. There are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. The midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). Metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. The long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma).

No surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed. He was lost to follow-up in 1993.

INDICATIONS:
  Ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post inferior wall myocardial infarction, status post left anterior descending PTCA and stenting.

PROCEDURE DONE:
  Adenosine Myoview stress test.

STRESS ECG RESULTS:
  The patient was stressed by intravenous adenosine, 140 mcg/kg/minute infused over four minutes.  The baseline resting electrocardiogram revealed an electronic pacemaker depolarizing the ventricles regularly at a rate of 70 beats per minute.  Underlying atrial fibrillation noted, very wide QRS complexes.  The heart rate remained unchanged at 70 beats per minute as the blood pressure decreased from 140/80 to 110/70 with adenosine infusion.    

MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:
  Resting myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging was carried out with 10.9 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview.  Adenosine infusion myocardial perfusion imaging and gated scan were carried out with 30 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview.  The lung heart ratio is 0.34.  A large transmural inferoseptal and apical perfusion defect of severe degree noted.  No evidence of perfusion abnormality along the left anterior descending territory, which was the site of a PTCA and stenting a year ago.  The gated scan revealed paradoxical septal motion, dyskinetic apical segment, severe inferior hypokinesis, mild to moderate anterolateral and basilar hypokinesis.  Ejection fraction is 27%.

CONCLUSIONS:

1.  Findings consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy.  Paradoxical septal motion consistent with abnormal ventricular depolarization related to right ventricular apical position of VVI pacemaker.  Apical dyskinesis, severe inferior hypokinesis, mild to moderate anterolateral and basilar hypokinesis.  Ejection fraction of 27%.
2.  Large inferoseptal and apical transmural scar.
3.  No evidence of adenosine-induced myocardial ischemia.  Specifically no reversible perfusion abnormalities seen in the territory of the left anterior descending, which underwent stenting a year ago.

CLINICAL:
Pain and swelling in the right foot, peroneal tendon tear.

FINDINGS:
  Contours of marrow signal patterns of the regional bones are within normal range treating there is increased T2 signal within the soft tissues at the lateral margin of the cuboid bone. A small effusion is noted within the peroneal tendon sheath. There is a 3mm slight separation of the distal tip of the peroneus longus tendon from the lateral margin of the cuboid bone, consistent with an avulsion. There is no sign of cuboid fracture. The fifth metatarsal base appears intact. The calcaneus is also normal in appearance.

IMPRESSION:  
Findings consistent with an avulsion of the peroneus longus tendon from the insertion on the lateral aspect of cuboid bone.


EXAM:
  Lexiscan Nuclear Myocardial Perfusion Scan.

INDICATION:
  Chest pain.

TYPE OF TEST:  
Lexiscan, unable to walk on a treadmill.

INTERPRETATION: 
 Resting heart rate of 96, blood pressure of 141/76.  EKG, normal sinus rhythm, nonspecific ST-T changes, left bundle branch block.  Post Lexiscan 0.4 mg injected intravenously by standard protocol.  Peak heart rate was 105, blood pressure of 135/72.  EKG remains the same.  No symptoms are noted.

SUMMARY:

1.  Nondiagnostic Lexiscan.
2.  Nuclear interpretation as below.

NUCLEAR MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION SCAN WITH STANDARD PROTOCOL:
  Resting and stress images were obtained with 10.4, 32.5 mCi of tetrofosmin injected intravenously by standard protocol.  Myocardial perfusion scan demonstrates homogeneous and uniform distribution of the tracer uptake.  There is no evidence of reversible or fixed defect.  Gated SPECT revealed mild global hypokinesis, more pronounced in the septal wall possibly secondary to prior surgery.  Ejection fraction calculated at 41%.  End-diastolic volume of 115, end-systolic volume of 68.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Normal nuclear myocardial perfusion scan.
2.  Ejection fraction 41% by gated SPECT.

CONFORMAL SIMULATION WITH COPLANAR BEAMS

This patient is undergoing a conformal simulation as the method to precisely define the area of disease which needs to be treated.  It allows us to highly focus the beam of radiation and shape the beam to the target volume, delivering a homogenous dosage through it while sparing the surrounding, more radiosensitive, normal tissues.  This will allow us to give the optimum chance of tumor control while minimizing the acute and long-term side effects.

A conformal simulation is a simulation which involves extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist time and effort.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room, where appropriate markers are placed, and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  One then approximates the field sizes and arrangements (gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields).  Radiographs are taken, and these fields are marked on the patient's skin.  The patient is then transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are then performed through the targeted area.  The CT scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist, and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on each slice of the CT scan.  The dosimetrist then evaluates each individual slice in the treatment planning computer with the appropriately marked structures.  This volume is then reconstructed in 3-dimensional space.  Utilizing the beam's-eye view features, the appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide homogenous coverage of the target volume while minimizing the dose to normal structures.  Once all appropriate beam parameters and isodate distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, each individual slice is then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, Cerrobend blocks will be custom fabricated.
If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where the computer-designed fields are re-simulated.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Bilateral fractures of the frontal process of the maxilla and with displacement to the right.
2.  The findings were reported to Dr. Xyz of the emergency room on 04/30/07 at 1715 hours.

EXAM: 
 Therapy intraarterial particulate administration.

HISTORY: 
 Hepatocellular carcinoma.

TECHNIQUE: 
 The patient was brought to the interventional radiology suite where catheterization of the right hepatic artery was performed.  The patient had previously given oral and written consent to the radioembolization procedure.  After confirmation of proper positioning of the hepatic artery catheter, 3.78 GBq of yttrium-90 TheraSphere microspheres were infused through the catheter under strict radiation safety procedures.

FINDINGS: 
 There were no apparent complications.  Using data on tumor burden, right lobe liver volume, vascularity of the tumor obtained from angiography and quantitative CT, and measurement of residual activity tumor, the expected radiation dose to the tumor burden in the right lobe of the liver was calculated at 201 Gy.  The expected dose to the remaining right liver parenchyma is 30 Gy.

Following the procedure there was no evidence of radioactive contamination of the room, equipment or personnel.

IMPRESSION: 
 Radioembolization therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma in the right lobe of the liver using 3.78 GBq of yttrium-90 microspheres TheraSphere.
        This is a middle-aged male with increasing memory loss and history of Lyme disease.

FINDINGS:

There is a large intrasellar mass lesion producing diffuse expansion of the sella turcica. This mass lesions measures approximately 16 x 18 x 18mm (craniocaudal x AP x mediolateral) in size.   The lesion extends into the left cavernous sinus along the inferior edge of the C3 segment of the left cavernous carotid artery obscuring the left cranial nerves III, IV and VI. The V1 and V2 branches however can be identified. There is intense enhancement of this lesion following gadolinium augmentation. There is a focal central area of nonenhancement which measures approximately 4mm in diameter. There is right-sided deviation of the infundibulum with mild convex bowing of this mass lesion into the suprasellar cistern, however, there is no impingement upon the optic chiasm. There is pressure erosion of the floor of the sella turcica bulging into the sphenoid sinus without a demonstrated cortical destruction or invasion of the sphenoid sinus.

The lesion most likely represents a macroadenoma. The intense enhancement of the central area of hypointense signal raises the possibility a calcification suggesting a differential diagnosis of a late onset craniopharyngioma. The lesion is not considered consistent with a meningioma. CT imaging would be of benefit for exclusion of calcification.

Normal flow within the carotid and vertebrobasilar circulation and there is no demonstrated aneurysm of the Circle of Willis.

Normal cerebral hemispheres and normal cortical gray matter and white matter tracks. There are no white matter hyperintensities. There is normal enhancement of the dural sinuses and cortical veins. There is no enhancing intraaxial or extraaxial mass lesion.

Normal basal ganglia and thalami. Normal internal and external capsules.

Normal midbrain, pons and medulla and a normal brainstem cervical cord junction.

Normal vermis and cerebellar hemispheres.

Normal calvarium. There is a 1.5cm retention cyst of the posterior wall of the left maxillary antrum. The paranasal sinuses are normal.

Normal temporal bones.

Normal central skull base.

Normal clivus and craniovertebral junction.

IMPRESSION:

Large intrasellar mass lesion with probable invasion of the left cavernous sinus. See above for size, morphology and pattern of enhancement. Differential considerations include a macroadenoma of the pituitary gland versus a craniopharyngioma. CT imaging is recommended for assessment of possible calcifications.

Retention cyst of the left maxillary antrum.

Normal supratentorial brainstem and posterior fossa.

CC:

HX:
 This 82y/o RHM was referred to the Neurology service by the Neurosurgery service for evaluation of acute onset paraplegia. He was in his usual state of health until 5:30PM on 4/6/95, when he developed sudden &quot;pressure-like&quot; epigastric discomfort associated with bilateral lower extremity weakness, SOB, lightheadedness and diaphoresis. He knelt down to the floor and &quot;went to sleep.&quot; The Emergency Medical Service was alert and arrived within minutes, at which time he was easily aroused though unable to move or feel his lower extremities. No associated upper extremity or bulbar dysfunction was noted. He was taken to a local hospital where an INR was found to be 9.1. He was given vitamin K 15mg, and transferred to UIHC to rule out spinal epidural hemorrhage. An MRI scan of the T-spine was obtained and the preliminary reading was &quot;normal.&quot; The Neurology service was then asked to evaluate the patient.

GEN EXAM: No carotid bruitts. Lungs: bibasilar crackles. CV: Irregular rate and rhythm with soft diastolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdomen: flat, soft, non-tender without bruitt or pulsatile mass. Distal pulses were strong in all extremities.

COURSE:
 Hgb 12.6, Hct 40%, WBC 11.7, Plt 154k, INR 7.6, PTT 50, CK 41, the GS was normal. EKG showed A-Fib at 75BPM with competing junctional pacemaker, essentially unchanged from 9/12/94.

It was suspected that the patient sustained an anterior-cervico-thoracic spinal cord infarction with resultant paraplegia and T6 sensory level. A CXR was done in the ER prior to admission. This revealed cardiomegaly and a widened mediastinum. He returned from the x-ray suite and suddenly became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitative measures failed. Pericardiocentesis was unremarkable. Autopsy revealed a massive aortic dissection extending from the aortic root to the origin of the iliac arteries with extensive pericardial hematoma. The dissection was seen in retrospect on the MRI T-spine.

MOTOR/SENSORY: bilateral decorticate posturing to noxious stimulation (chest).

Reflexes: bilaterally.

Laceration of mid forehead exposing calvarium.

COURSE:
 Emergent Brain CT scan revealed: Displaced fracture of left calvarium. Left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Right ventricular collection of blood. Right cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Significant mass effect with deviation of the midline structures to right. The left ventricle was compressed with obliteration of the suprasellar cistern. Air within the soft tissues in the left infra temporal region. C-spine XR, Abdominal/Chest CT were unremarkable.

Patient was taken to the OR emergently and underwent bifrontal craniotomy, evacuation of a small epidural and subdural hematomas, and duraplasty. He was given mannitol enroute to the OR and hyperventilated during and after the procedure. Postoperatively he continued to manifest decerebrate posturing . On 11/16/92 he underwent VP shunting with little subsequent change in his neurological status. On 11/23/92 he underwent tracheostomy. On 12/11/92 he underwent bifrontal acrylic prosthesis implantation for repair of the bifrontal craniectomy. By the time of discharge, 1/14/93, he tracked relatively well OD, but had a CN3 palsy OS. He had relatively severe extensor rigidity in all extremities (R&gt;L). His tracheotomy was closed prior to discharge. A 11/16/92 Brain MRI demonstrated infarction in the upper brain stem (particularly in the Pons), left cerebellum, right basil ganglia and thalamus.

He was initially treated for seizure prophylaxis with DPH, but developed neutropenia, so it was discontinued. He developed seizures within several months of discharge and was placed on VPA (Depakene). This decreased seizure frequency but his liver enzymes became elevated and he changed over to Tegretol. 10/8/93 Brain MRI (one year after MVA) revealed interval appearance of hydrocephalus, abnormal increased T2 signal (in the medulla, right pons, both basal ganglia, right frontal and left occipital regions), a small mid-brain, and a right subdural fluid collection. These findings were consistent with diffuse axonal injury of the white matter and gray matter contusion, and signs of a previous right subdural hematoma.

He was last seen 10/30/96 in the pediatric neurology clinic--age 9 years. He was averaging 2-3 seizures per day---characterized by extension of BUE with tremor and audible cry or laughter---on Tegretol and Diazepam. In addition he experiences 24-48hour periods of &quot;startle response (myoclonic movement of the shoulders)&quot; with or without stimulation every 6 weeks. He had limited communication skills (sparse speech). On exam he had disconjugate gaze, dilated/fixed left pupil, spastic quadriplegia.

CC:
 Falls.

HX: 
This 51y/o RHF fell four times on 1/3/93, because her &quot;legs suddenly gave out.&quot; She subsequently noticed weakness involving the right leg, and often required the assistance of her arms to move it. During some of these episodes she appeared mildly pale and felt generally weak; her husband would give her 3 teaspoons of sugar and she would appear to improve, thought not completely. During one episode she held her RUE in an &quot;odd fisted posture.&quot; She denied any other focal weakness, sensory change, dysarthria, diplopia, dysphagia or alteration of consciousness. She did not seek medical attention despite her weakness. Then, last night, 1/4/93, she fell again ,and because her weakness did not subsequently improve she came to UIHC for evaluation on 1/5/93.

Gen Exam: unremarkable.

COURSE:
 CBC, GS (including glucose), PT/PTT, EKG, CXR on admission, 1/5/93, were unremarkable. HCT, 1/5/93, revealed a hypodensity in the left caudate consistent with ischemic change. Carotid Duplex: 0-15%RICA, 16-49%LICA; antegrade vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed borderline LV hypertrophy and normal LV function. No valvular abnormalities or thrombus were seen.

The patient's history and exam findings of right facial and RLE weakness with sparing of the RUE would invoke a RACA territory stroke with recurrent artery of Heubner involvement causing the facial weakness.

EXAM:
MRI LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST

CLINICAL:
This is a 53-year-old female with left knee pain being evaluated for ACL tear.

FINDINGS:

This examination was performed on 10-14-05.

Normal medial meniscus without intrasubstance degeneration, surface fraying or discrete meniscal tear.

There is a discoid lateral meniscus and although there may be minimal superficial fraying along the inner edge of the body, there is no discrete tear (series #6 images #7-12).

There is a near-complete or complete tear of the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament. The ligament has a balled-up appearance consistent with at least partial retraction of most of the fibers of the ligament. There may be a few fibers still intact (series #4 images #12-14; series #5 images #12-14). The tibial fibers are normal.

Normal posterior cruciate ligament.

There is a sprain of the medial collateral ligament, with mild separation of the deep and superficial fibers at the femoral attachment (series #7 images #6-12). There is no complete tear or discontinuity and there is no meniscocapsular separation.

There is a sprain of the lateral ligament complex without focal tear or discontinuity of any of the intraarticular components.

Normal iliotibial band.

Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons.

There is contusion within the posterolateral corner of the tibia. There is also contusion within the patella at the midline patellar ridge where there is an area of focal chondral flattening (series #8 images #10-13). The medial and lateral patellar facets are otherwise normal as is the femoral trochlea in the there is no patellar subluxation.

There is a mild strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle extending into the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum but there is no complete tear or discontinuity.

Normal lateral patellar retinaculum. There is a joint effusion and plica.

IMPRESSION:
 Discoid lateral meniscus without a tear although there may be minimal superficial fraying along the inner edge of the body.  Near-complete if not complete tear of the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament.  Medial capsule sprain with associated strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle.  There is focal contusion within the patella at the midline patella ridge. Joint effusion and plica.

REASON FOR CT SCAN: 
 The patient is a 79-year-old man with adult hydrocephalus who was found to have large bilateral effusions on a CT scan performed on January 16, 2008.  I changed the shunt setting from 1.5 to 2.0 on February 12, 2008 and his family obtained this repeat CT scan to determine whether his subdural effusions were improving.

CT scan from 03/11/2008 demonstrates frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 2.6 cm.  The 3rd ventricular contour which is flat with a 3rd ventricular span of 10 mm.  There is a single shunt, which enters on the right occipital side and ends in the left lateral ventricle.  He has symmetric bilateral subdurals that are less than 1 cm in breadth each, which is a reduction from the report from January 16, 2008, which states that he had a subdural hygroma, maximum size 1.3 cm on the right and 1.1 cm on the left.

ASSESSMENT: 
 The patient's subdural effusions are still noticeable, but they are improving at the setting of 2.0.

PLAN: 
 I would like to see the patient with a new head CT in about three months, at which time we can decide whether 2.0 is the appropriate setting for him to remain at or whether we can consider changing the shunt setting.

PROCEDURE DONE:  
Resting Myoview and adenosine Myoview SPECT.

INDICATIONS:
  Chest pain.

PROCEDURE:
  13.3 mCi of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was injected and resting Myoview SPECT was obtained.  Pharmacologic stress testing was done using adenosine infusion.  Patient received 38 mg of adenosine infused at 140 mcg/kg/minute over a period of four minutes.  Two minutes during adenosine infusion, 31.6 mCi of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was injected.  Resting heart rate was 90 beats per minute.  Resting blood pressure was 130/70.  Peak heart rate obtained during adenosine infusion was 102 beats per minute.  Blood pressure obtained during adenosine infusion was 112/70.  During adenosine infusion, patient experienced dizziness and shortness of breath.  No significant ST segment, T wave changes, or arrhythmias were seen.

Resting Myoview and adenosine Myoview SPECT showed uniform uptake of isotope throughout myocardium without any perfusion defect.  Gated dynamic imaging showed normal wall motion and normal systolic thickening throughout left ventricular myocardium.  Left ventricular ejection fraction obtained during adenosine Myoview SPECT was 77%.  Lung heart ratio was 0.40.  TID ratio was 0.88.

IMPRESSION:
  Normal adenosine Myoview myocardial perfusion SPECT.  Normal left ventricular regional and global function with left ventricular ejection fraction of 77%. 

EXAM: 
 MRI of lumbar spine without contrast.

HISTORY:
  A 24-year-old female with chronic back pain.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Noncontrast axial and sagittal images were acquired through the lumbar spine in varying degrees of fat and water weighting.

FINDINGS: 
 The visualized cord is normal in signal intensity and morphology with conus terminating in proper position.  Visualized osseous structures are normal in marrow signal intensity and morphology without evidence for fracture/contusion, compression deformity, or marrow replacement process.  There are no paraspinal masses.

Disc heights, signal, and vertebral body heights are maintained throughout the lumbar spine.

L5-S1:  Central canal, neural foramina are patent.
L4-L5:  Central canal, neural foramina are patent.
L3-L4:  Central canal, neural foramen is patent.
L2-L3:  Central canal, neural foramina are patent.
L1-L2:  Central canal, neural foramina are patent.

The visualized abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.  Incidental note has been made of multiple left-sided ovarian, probable physiologic follicular cysts.

IMPRESSION: 
 No acute disease in the lumbar spine.

CC:
 Progressive lower extremity weakness.

HX: 
This 52y/o RHF had a h/o right frontal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection, on 1/15/1991. She had been healthy until 1/6/91, when she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure during the night. She subsequently underwent an MRI brain scan and was found to have a right frontal enhancing lesion in the mesial aspect of the right frontal lobe at approximately the level of the coronal suture. There was minimal associated edema and no mass effect. Following extirpation of the tumor mass, she underwent radioactive Iodine implantation and 6020cGy radiation therapy in 35 fractions. In 11/91 she received BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy protocols. This was followed by four courses of 5FU/Carboplatin (3/92, 6/92, 9/92 ,10/92) chemotherapy.

On 10/12/92 she presented for her 4th course of 5FU/Carboplatin and complained of non-radiating dull low back pain, and proximal lower extremity weakness, but was still able to ambulate. She denied any bowel/bladder difficulty.

EXAM: 
Vitals unremarkable.

MS: Unremarkable.

Motor: 5/5 BUE, LE: 4+/5- prox, 5/5 distal to hips. Normal tone and muscle bulk.

Sensory: No deficits appreciated.

Coord: Unremarkable.

Station: No mention in record of being tested.

Gait: Mild difficulty climbing stairs.

Reflexes: 1+/1+ throughout and symmetric. Plantar responses were down-going bilaterally.

INITIAL IMPRESSION:
 Steroid myopathy. Though there was enough of a suspicion of &quot;drop&quot; metastasis that an MRI of the L-spine was obtained.

COURSE:
 The MRI L-spine revealed fine linear enhancement along the dorsal aspect of the conus medullaris, suggestive of subarachnoid seeding of tumor. No focal mass or cord compression was visualized. CSF examination revealed: 19RBC, 22WBC, 17 Lymphocytes, and 5 histiocytes, Glucose 56, Protein 150. Cytology (negative). The patient was discharged home on 10/17/92, but experienced worsening back pain and lower extremity weakness and became predominantly wheelchair bound within 4 months. She was last seen on 3/3/93 and showed signs of worsening weakness (left hemiplegia: R &gt; L) as her tumor grew and spread. She then entered a hospice.

HISTORY: 
 The patient is a 78-year-old right-handed inpatient with longstanding history of cervical spinal stenosis status post decompression, opioid dependence, who has had longstanding low back pain radiating into the right leg.  She was undergoing a spinal epidural injection about a month ago and had worsening of right low back pain, which radiates down into her buttocks and down to posterior aspect of her thigh into her knee.  This has required large amounts of opioid analgesics to control.  She has been basically bedridden because of this.  She was brought into hospital for further investigations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 On examination, she has positive straight leg rising on the right with severe shooting, radicular type pain with right leg movement.  Difficult to assess individual muscles, but strength is largely intact.  Sensory examination is symmetric.  Deep tendon reflexes reveal hyporeflexia in both patellae, which probably represents a cervical myelopathy from prior cord compression.  She has slightly decreased right versus left ankle reflexes.  The Babinski's are positive.  On nerve conduction studies, motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in lower extremities.

NEEDLE EMG: 
 Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It reveals the spontaneous activity in right peroneus longus and gastrocnemius medialis muscles as well as the right lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles.  There is evidence of denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis muscle.

IMPRESSION: 
 This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:
1.  Inactive right S1 (L5) radiculopathy.
2.  There is no evidence of left lower extremity radiculopathy, peripheral neuropathy or entrapment neuropathy.

Results were discussed with the patient and she is scheduled for imaging studies in the next day.

2-D STUDY

1. Mild aortic stenosis, widely calcified, minimally restricted.
2. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy but normal systolic function.
3. Moderate biatrial enlargement.
4. Normal right ventricle.
5. Normal appearance of the tricuspid and mitral valves.
6. Normal left ventricle and left ventricular systolic function.

DOPPLER

1. There is 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation easily seen, but no aortic stenosis.
2. Mild tricuspid regurgitation with only mild increase in right heart pressures, 30-35 mmHg maximum.

SUMMARY

1. Normal left ventricle.
2. Moderate biatrial enlargement.
3. Mild tricuspid regurgitation, but only mild increase in right heart pressures.

EXAM:  
Ultrasound neck/soft tissue, head.

HISTORY: 
 Right-sided facial swelling and draining wound.

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:
  Ultrasound of the right mandibular region was performed.

No focal collection is identified.  This whole region appears to be phlegmonous.  It is hard to adequately delineate the exact margins of this region.

IMPRESSION:  
Abnormal appearing right mandibular region has more phlegmonous changes.  No focal fluid collection.

Had a discussion with Dr. xx.  Consider CT for further evaluation.

EXAM: 
 Bilateral diagnostic mammogram and right breast ultrasound.

History of palpable abnormality at 10 o'clock in the right breast.  Family history of a sister with breast cancer at age 43.

TECHNIQUE: 
 CC and MLO views of both breasts were obtained.  Spot compression views of the palpable area were also obtained.  Right breast ultrasound was performed.  Comparison is made with mm/dd/yy.

FINDINGS: 
 The breast parenchymal pattern is stable with heterogeneous scattered areas of fibroglandular tissue.  No new mass or architectural distortion is evident.  Asymmetric density in the upper outer posterior left breast and a nodule in the upper outer right breast are unchanged.  There is no suspicious cluster of microcalcifications.

Directed ultrasonography of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast revealed no cystic or hypoechoic solid mass.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Stable mammographic appearance from mm/dd/yy.
2.  No sonographic evidence of a mass at 10 o'clock in the right breast to correspond to the palpable abnormality.  The need for further assessment of a palpable abnormality should be determined clinically.

Station: 3-4step retropulsion.

Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout BUE and patellae. 1/1 Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor.

Gen Exam: Inremarkable. HEENT: unremarkable.

COURSE:
 The patient continued Sinemet CR 25/100 1tab TID and was told to monitor orthostatic BP at home. The evaluating Neurologist became concerned that she may have Parkinsonism plus dysautonomia.

She was seen again on 5/28/96 and reported no improvement in her condition. In addition she complained of worsening lightheadedness upon standing and had an episode, 1 week prior to 5/28/96, in which she was at her kitchen table and became unable to move. There were no involuntary movements or alteration in sensorium/mental status. During the episode she recalled wanting to turn, but could not. Two weeks prior to 5/28/96 she had an episode of orthostatic syncope in which she struck her head during a fall. She discontinued Sinemet 5 days prior to 5/28/96 and felt better. She felt she was moving slower and that her micrographia had worsened. She had had recent difficulty rolling over in bed and has occasional falls when turning. She denied hypophonia, dysphagia or diplopia.

On EXAM: BP (supine)153/110 with HR 88. BP (standing)110/80 with HR 96. (+) Myerson's sign and mild hypomimia, but no hypophonia. There was normal blinking and EOM. Motor strength was full throughout. No resting tremor, but mild postural tremor present. No rigidity noted. Mild decrement on finger tapping noted. Reflexes were symmetric. No Babinski signs and no clonus. Gait was short stepped with mild anteroflexed posture. She was unable to turn on point. 3-4 step Retropulsion noted. The Parkinsonism had been unresponsive to Sinemet and she had autonomic dysfunction suggestive of Shy-Drager syndrome. It was recommended that she liberalize dietary salt use and lie with head of the bed elevate at 20-30 degrees at night. Indomethacin was suggested to improve BP in future.

CC:
 Episodic mental status change and RUE numbness, and chorea (found on exam).

HX:
 This 78y/o RHM was referred for an episode of unusual behavior and RUE numbness. In 9/91, he experienced near loss of consciousness, generalized weakness, headache and vomiting. Evaluation at that time revealed an serum glucose of &gt;500mg/dL and he was placed on insulin therapy with subsequent resolution of his signs and symptoms. Since then, he became progressively more forgetful, and at the time of evaluation, 1/17/93, had lost his ability to perform his job repairing lawn mowers. His wife had taken over the family finances.

He had also been &quot;stumbling,&quot; when ambulating, for 2 months prior to presentation. He was noted to be occasionally confused upon awakening for last several months. On 1/15/93, he was lying on a couch when he suddenly began throwing pillows and blankets for no apparent reason. There had been no change in sleep, appetite, or complaint of depression.

In addition, for two months prior to presentation, he had been experiencing 10-15minute episodes of RUE numbness. There was no face or lower extremity involvement.

During the last year he had developed unusual movements of his extremities.

COURSE:
 No family history of Huntington's disease could be elicited from relatives. Brain CT, 1/18/93: bilateral calcification of the globus pallidi and a high attenuation focus in the right occipital lobe thought to represent artifact. Carotid duplex, 1/18/93: RICA 0-15%, LICA 16-49% stenosis and normal vertebral artery flow bilaterally. Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE),1/18/93: revealed severe aortic fibrosis or valvular calcification with &quot;severe&quot; aortic stenosis in the face of &quot;normal&quot; LV function. Cardiology felt the patient the patient had asymptomatic aortic stenosis. EEG, 1/20/93, showed low voltage Delta over the left posterior quadrant and intermittent background slowing over the same region consistent with focal dysfunction in this quadrant. MRI Brain, 1/22/93: multiple focal and more confluent areas of increased T2 signal in the periventricular white matter, more prominent on the left; in addition, there were irregular shaped areas of increased T2 signal and decreased T1 signal in both cerebellar hemispheres; and age related atrophy; incidentally, there is a cavum septum pellucidum et vergae and mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses. Impression: diffuse bilateral age related ischemic change, age related atrophy and maxillary sinus disease. There were no masses or areas of abnormal enhancement. TSH, FT4, Vit B12, VDRL, Urine drug and heavy metal screens were unremarkable. CSF,1/19/93: glucose 102 (serum glucose 162mg/dL), Protein 45mg/dL, RBC O, WBC O, Cultures negative. SPEP negative. However serum and CSF beta2 microglobulin levels were elevated at 2.5 and 3.1mg/L, respectively. Hematology felt these may have been false positives. CBC, 1/17/93: Hgb 10.4g/dL (low), HCT 31% (low), RBC 3/34mil/mm3 (low), WBC 5.8K/mm3, Plt 201K/mm3. Retic 30/1K/mm3 (normal). Serum Iron 35mcg/dL (low), TIBC 201mcg/dL (low), FeSat 17% (low), CRP 0.1mg/dL (normal), ESR 83mm/hr (high). Bone Marrow Bx: normal with adequate iron stores. Hematology felt the finding were compatible with anemia of chronic disease. Neuropsychologic evaluation on 1/17/93 revealed significant impairments in multiple realms of cognitive function (visuospatial reasoning, verbal and visual memory, visual confrontational naming, impaired arrhythmatic, dysfluent speech marked by use of phrases no longer than 5 words, frequent word finding difficulty and semantic paraphasic errors) most severe for expressive language, attention and memory. The pattern of findings reveals an atypical aphasia suggestive of left temporo-parietal dysfunction. The patient was discharged1/22/93 on ASA 325mg qd. He was given a diagnosis of senile chorea and dementia (unspecified type). 6/18/93 repeat Neuropsychological evaluation revealed moderate decline in all areas tested reflecting severe dementia.

EXAM:
  CT cervical spine (C-spine) for trauma.

FINDINGS:
  CT examination of the cervical spine was performed without contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained for better anatomical localization.  Cervical vertebral body height, alignment and interspacing are maintained.  There is no evidence of fractures or destructive osseous lesions.  There are no significant degenerative endplate or facet changes.  No significant osseous central canal or foraminal narrowing is present.

IMPRESSION: 
 Negative cervical spine.

CC: 
Difficulty with speech.

HX:
 This 84 y/o RHF presented with sudden onset word finding and word phonation difficulties. She had an episode of transient aphasia in 2/92 during which she had difficulty with writing, written and verbal comprehension, and exhibited numerous semantic and phonemic paraphasic errors of speech. These problems resolved within 24 hours of onset and she had no subsequent speech problems prior to this presentation. Workup at that time revealed a right to left shunt on trans-thoracic echocardiogram. Carotid doppler studies showed 0-15% BICA stenosis and a LICA aneurysm (mentioned above). Brain CT was unremarkable. She was placed on ASA after the 2/92 event.

In 5/92 she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered a fractured left humerus and left occipital scalp laceration. HCT at that time showed a small area of slightly increased attenuation at the posterior right claustrum only. This was not felt to be a contusion; nevertheless, she was placed on Dilantin seizure prophylaxis. Her left arm was casted and she returned home.

5 hours prior to presentation today, the patient began having difficulty finding words and putting them into speech. She was able to comprehend speech. This continued for an hour; then partially resolved for one hour; then returned; then waxed and waned. There was no reported weakness, numbness, incontinence, seizure-like activity, incoordination, HA, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness

INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a complex set of procedures which requires appropriate positioning and immobilization typically with customized immobilization devices.  The treatment planning process requires at least 4 hours of physician time.  The technology is appropriate in this patient's case due to the fact that the target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures.  Sequential CT scans are obtained and transferred to the treatment planning software.  Extensive analysis occurs.  The target volumes, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected.  In addition, organs at risk are outlined.  Doses are selected both for targets, as well as for organs at risk.  Associated dose constraints are placed.  Inverse treatment planning is then performed in conjunction with the physics staff.  These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician.  Multiple beam arrangements may be tested for appropriateness and optimal dose delivery in order to maximize the chance of controlling disease, while minimizing exposure to organs at risk.  This is performed in hopes of minimizing associated complications.  The physician delineates the treatment type, number of fractions and total volume.  During the time of treatment, there is extensive physician intervention, monitoring the patient set up and tolerance.  In addition, specific QA is performed by the physics staff under the physician's direction.

In view of the above, the special procedure code 77470 is deemed appropriate.

EXAM: 
 MRI of the brain without contrast.

HISTORY: 
 Daily headaches for 6 months in a 57-year-old.

TECHNIQUE:  
Noncontrast axial and sagittal images were acquired through the brain in varying degrees of fat and water weighting.

FINDINGS: 
 The brain is normal in signal intensity and morphology for age.  There are no extraaxial fluid collections.  There is no hydrocephalus/midline shift.  Posterior fossa, 7th and 8th nerve complexes and intraorbital contents are within normal limits.  The normal vascular flow volumes are maintained.  The paranasal sinuses are clear.

Diffusion images demonstrate no area of abnormally restricted diffusion that suggests acute infarct.

IMPRESSION: 
 Normal MRI brain.  Specifically, no findings to explain the patient's headaches are identified.

HISTORY: 
 Coronary artery disease.

TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  
Calcium scoring and coronary artery CTA with cardiac function was performed on Siemens dual-source CT scanner with postprocessing on Vitrea workstation.  Patient received oral Metoprolol 100 milligrams.  100 ml Ultravist 370 was utilized as the contrast agent.  0.4 milligrams of nitroglycerin was given.

Patient's calcium score 164, volume 205; this places the patient between the 75th and 90th percentile for age.  There is at least moderate atherosclerotic plaque with mild coronary artery disease and significant narrowings possible.

Cardiac wall motion was within normal limits.  Left ventricular ejection fraction calculated to be 82%.  End-diastolic volume 98 mL, end-systolic volume calculated to be 18 mL.

There is normal coronary artery origins.  There is codominance between the right coronary artery and the circumflex artery.  There is mild to moderate stenosis of the proximal LAD with mixed plaque.  Mild stenosis mid LAD with mixed plaque.  No stenosis.  Distal LAD with the distal vessel becoming diminutive in size.  Right coronary artery shows mild stenosis proximally and in the midportion due to calcified focal plaque.  Once again the distal vessel becomes diminutive in size.  Circumflex shows mild stenosis due to focal calcified plaque proximally.  No stenosis is seen involving the mid or distal circumflex.  The distal circumflex also becomes diminutive in size.  The left main shows small amount of focal calcified plaque without stenosis.  Myocardium, pericardium and wall motion was unremarkable as seen.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with values as above.  There are areas of stenosis most pronounced in the LAD with mild to moderate change and mild stenosis involving the circumflex and right coronary artery.
2.  Consider cardiology consult and further evaluation if clinically indicated.
3.  Full report was sent to the PACS.  Report will be mailed to Dr. ABC.

MYOVIEW NUCLEAR STRESS STUDY

REASON FOR THE TEST:
  Angina, coronary artery disease.

FINDINGS: 
 The patient exercised according to the Lexiscan nuclear stress study, received a total of 0.4 mg of Lexiscan.  At peak hyperemic effect, 25.8 mCi of Myoview injected for the stress imaging and earlier 8.1 mCi of Myoview injected for the resting and the usual SPECT and gated SPECT protocol was followed in the rest-stress sequence.

The data analyzed using Cedars-Sinai software.

The resting heart rate was 49 with the resting blood pressure of 149/86.  Maximum heart rate achieved was 69 with a maximum blood pressure achieved of 172/76.

EKG at rest showed to be abnormal with sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and inverted T-wave in 1, 2, and aVL as well as from V4 to V6 with LVH.  Maximal stress test EKG showed no change from baseline.

IMPRESSION:  
Maximal Lexiscan stress test with abnormal EKG at baseline maximal stress test, please refer to the Myoview interpretation.

MYOVIEW INTERPRETATIONS

FINDINGS: 
 The left ventricle appears to be dilated on both stress and rest with no significant change between stress and rest with left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 227, end-systolic volume of 154 with moderately to severely reduced LV function with akinesis of the inferior and inferoseptal wall.  EF was calculated at 32%, estimated 35% to 40%.

Cardiac perfusion reviewed, showed a large area of moderate-to-severe intensity in the inferior wall and small-to-medium area of severe intensity at the apex and inferoapical wall.  Both defects showed no change on the resting indicative of a fixed defect in the inferior and inferoapical wall consistent with old inferior inferoapical MI.  No reversible defects indicative of myocardium at risk.  The lateral walls as well as the septum and most of the anterior wall showed no reversibility and near-normal perfusion.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Large fixed defect, inferior and apical wall, related to old myocardial infarction.
2.  No reversible ischemia identified.
3.  Moderately reduced left ventricular function with ejection fraction of about 35% consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

CC:
 Headache.

HX: 
The patient is an 8y/o RHM with a 2 year history of early morning headaches (3:00-6:00AM) intermittently relieved by vomiting only. He had been evaluated 2 years ago and an EEG was &quot;normal&quot; then, but no brain imaging was performed. His headaches progressively worsened, especially in the past two months prior to this presentation. For 2 weeks prior to his 1/25/93 evaluation at UIHC, he would awake screaming. His parent spoke with a local physician who thought this might be due to irritability secondary to pinworms and

Vermox was prescribed and arrangements were made for a neurologic evaluation. On the evening of 1/24/93 the patient awoke screaming and began to vomit. This was followed by a 10 min period of tonic-clonic type movements and postictal lethargy. He was taken to a local ER and a brain CT revealed an intracranial mass. He was given Decadron and Phenytoin and transferred to UIHC for further evaluation.

Gen exam: unremarkable.

COURSE:
 The patient was continued on Dilantin 200mg qd and Decadron 5mg IV q6hrs. Brain MRI, 1/26/93, revealed a large mass lesion in the region of the left caudate nucleus and thalamus which was hyperintense on T2 weighted images. There were areas of cystic formation at its periphery. The mass appeared to enhance on post gadolinium images. there was associated white matter edema and compression of the left lateral ventricle, and midline shift to the right. There was no sign of uncal herniation. He underwent bilateral VP shunting on 1/26/93; and then, subtotal resection (left frontal craniotomy with excision of the left caudate and thalamus with creation of an opening in the septum pellucidum) on 1/28/93. He then received 5040cGy of radiation therapy in 28 fractions completed on 3/25/93. A 3/20/95 neuropsychological evaluation revealed low average intellect on the WISC-III. There were also signs of memory, attention, reading and spelling deficits; and mild right-sided motor incoordination and mood variability. He remained in mainstream classes at school, but his physical and cognitive performance began to deteriorate in 4/95. Neurosurgical evaluation in 4/95 noted increased right hemiplegia and right homonymous hemianopia. MRI revealed tumor progression and he was subsequently placed on Carboplatin/VP-16 (CG 9933 protocol chemotherapy, regimen A). He was last seen on 4/96 and was having difficulty in the 6th grade; he was also undergoing physical therapy for his right hemiplegia.

EXAM: 
 MRI orbit/face/neck with and without contrast; MR angiography of the head

CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 1-day-old female with facial mass.

TECHNIQUE:

1.  Multisequence, multiplanar images of the orbits/face/neck were obtained with and without contrast.  0.5 ml Magnevist was used as the intravenous contrast agent.
2.  MR angiography of the head was obtained using a time-of-flight technique.
3.  The patient was under general anesthesia during the exam.

FINDINGS:
  MRI orbits/face/neck:  There is a pedunculated mass measuring 5.7 x 4.4 x 6.7 cm arising from the patient's lip on the right side.  The mass demonstrates a heterogeneous signal.  There is also heterogeneous enhancement which may relate to a high vascular tumor given the small amount of contrast for the exam.  The origin of the mass from the upper lip demonstrates intact soft tissue planes.

Limited evaluation of the head demonstrates normal appearing midline structures.  Incidental note is made of a small arachnoid cyst within the anterior left middle cranial fossa.  The mastoid air cells on the right are opacified; while the left demonstrates appropriate aeration.

MR angiography of the head:  Angiography is limited such that the vessel feeding the mass cannot be identified with certainty.  The right external carotid artery is noted to be asymmetrically larger than the left, the phenomenon likely related to provision of feeding vessels to the mass.  There is no carotid stenosis.

IMPRESSION:

1.  The mass arising from the right upper lip measures 5.7 x 4.4 x 6.7 cm with a heterogeneous appearance and enhancement pattern.  Hemangioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis as well as other mesenchymal neoplasms.
2.  MR angiography is suboptimal such that feeding vessels to the mass cannot be identified with certainty.

INDICATIONS:  
Chest pain, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus.

PROCEDURE DONE:
  Dobutamine Myoview stress test.

STRESS ECG RESULTS:
  The patient was stressed by dobutamine infusion at a rate of 10 mcg/kg/minute for three minutes, 20 mcg/kg/minute for three minutes, and 30 mcg/kg/minute for three additional minutes.  Atropine 0.25 mg was given intravenously eight minutes into the dobutamine infusion.  The resting electrocardiogram reveals a regular sinus rhythm with heart rate of 86 beats per minute, QS pattern in leads V1 and V2, and diffuse nonspecific T wave abnormality.  The heart rate increased from 86 beats per minute to 155 beats per minute, which is about 90% of the maximum predicted target heart rate.  The blood pressure increased from 130/80 to 160/70.  A maximum of 1 mm J-junctional depression was seen with fast up sloping ST segments during dobutamine infusion.  No ischemic ST segment changes were seen during dobutamine infusion or during the recovery process.

MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:
  Resting myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging was carried out with 10.9 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview.  Dobutamine infusion myocardial perfusion imaging and gated scan were carried out with 29.2 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview.  The lung heart ratio is 0.36.  Myocardial perfusion images were normal both at rest and with stress.  Gated myocardial scan revealed normal regional wall motion and ejection fraction of 67%.

CONCLUSIONS:

1.  Stress test is negative for dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia.
2.  Normal left ventricular size, regional wall motion, and ejection fraction.

EXAM: 
 CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast.

REASON FOR EXAM:

TECHNIQUE: 
 Multiple axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained.  5-mm slices were acquired after injection of 125 cc of Omnipaque IV.  In addition, oral ReadiCAT was given.  Reformatted sagittal and coronal images were obtained.

DISCUSSION:
  There are numerous subcentimeter nodules seen within the lung bases.  The largest measures up to 6 mm.  No hiatal hernia is identified.  Consider chest CT for further evaluation of the pulmonary nodules.  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal limits.  No dilated loops of bowel.  There are punctate foci of air seen within the nondependent portions of the peritoneal cavity as well as the anterior subcutaneous fat.  In addition, there is soft tissue stranding seen of the lower pelvis.  In addition, the uterus is not identified.  Correlate with history of recent surgery.  There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy seen within the abdomen or pelvis.  The bladder is within normal limits for technique.

No acute bony abnormalities appreciated.  No suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Postoperative changes seen within the pelvis without appreciable evidence for free fluid.
2.  Numerous subcentimeter nodules seen within the lung bases.  Consider chest CT for further characterization.

COURSE:
 CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, FT4, TSH, ANA, Vit B12, Folate, VDRL and Urinalysis were normal. MRI T-spine, 10/27/92, was unremarkable. MRI Brain, 10/28/92, revealed multiple areas of abnormally increased signal on T2 weighted images in the white matter regions of the right corpus callosum, periventricular region, brachium pontis and right pons. The appearance of the lesions was felt to be strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. 10/28/92, Lumbar puncture revealed the following CSF results: RBC 1, WBC 9 (8 lymphocytes, 1 histiocyte), Glucose 55mg/dl, Protein 46mg/dl (normal 15-45), CSF IgG 7.5mg/dl (normal 0.0-6.2), CSF IgG index 1.3 (normal 0.0-0.7), agarose gel electrophoresis revealed oligoclonal bands in the gamma region which were not seen on the serum sample. Beta-2 microglobulin was unremarkable. An abnormal left tibial somatosensory evoked potential was noted consistent with central conduction slowing. Visual and Brainstem Auditory evoked potentials were normal. HTLV-1 titers were negative. CSF cultures and cytology were negative. She was not treated with medications as her symptoms were primarily sensory and non-debilitating, and she was discharged home.

She returned on 11/7/92 as her symptoms of RUE dysesthesia, lower extremity paresthesia and weakness, all worsened. On 11/6/92, she developed slow slurred speech and had marked difficulty expressing her thoughts. She also began having difficulty emptying her bladder. Her 11/7/92 exam was notable for normal vital signs, lying motionless with eyes open and nodding and rhythmically blinking every few minutes. She was oriented to place and time of day, but not to season, day of the week and she did not know who she was. She had a leftward gaze preference and right lower facial weakness. Her RLE was spastic with sustained ankle clonus. There was dysesthetic sensory perception in the RUE. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present.

MRI brain, 11/7/92, revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal region is more prominent than on prior study. The left centrum semiovale lesion has less enhancement than previously. Multiple other white matter lesions are demonstrated on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions on both sides have increased in size since the 10/92 MRI. The findings were felt more consistent with demyelinating disease and less likely glioma. Post-viral encephalitis, Rapidly progressive demyelinating disease and tumor were in the differential diagnosis. Lumbar Puncture, 11/8/92, revealed: RBC 2, WBC 12 (12 lymphocytes), Glucose 57, Protein 51 (elevated), cytology and cultures were negative. HIV 1 titer was negative. Urine drug screen, negative. A stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto-occipital region was consistent with demyelinating disease. She was treated with Decadron 6mg IV qhours and Cytoxan 0.75gm/m2 (1.25gm). On 12/3/92, she has a focal motor seizure with rhythmic jerking of the LUE, loss of consciousness and rightward eye deviation. EEG revealed diffuse slowing with frequent right-sided sharp discharges. She was placed on Dilantin. She became depressed.

EXAM:
MRI SPINAL CORD CERVICAL WITHOUT CONTRAST

CLINICAL:
Right arm pain, numbness and tingling.

FINDINGS:

Vertebral alignment and bone marrow signal characteristics are unremarkable. The C2-3 and C3-4 disk levels appear unremarkable.

At C4-5, broad based disk/osteophyte contacts the ventral surface of the spinal cord and may mildly indent the cord contour. A discrete cord signal abnormality is not identified. There may also be some narrowing of the neuroforamina at this level.

At C5-6, central disk-osteophyte contacts and mildly impresses on the ventral cord contour. Distinct neuroforaminal narrowing is not evident.

At C6-7, mild diffuse disk-osteophyte impresses on the ventral thecal sac and contacts the ventral cord surface. Distinct cord compression is not evident. There may be mild narrowing of the neuroforamina at his level.

A specific abnormality is not identified at the C7-T1 level.

IMPRESSION:

Disk/osteophyte at C4-5 through C6-7 with contact and may mildly indent the ventral cord contour at these levels. Some possible neuroforaminal narrowing is also noted at levels as stated above.
        This is a middle-aged female with memory loss. Patient has history of breast carcinoma. Evaluate for metastatic disease.

FINDINGS:

There is moderate to severe generalized neuronal loss of the cerebral hemispheres with moderate to severe ventricular enlargement and prominent CSF within the subarachnoid spaces. There is confluent white matter hyperintensity in a bi-hemispherical centrum semiovale distribution extending to the lateral ventricles consistent with severe vasculopathic small vessel disease and extensive white matter ischemic changes. There is normal enhancement of the dural sinuses and cortical veins and there are no enhancing intra-axial or extraaxial mass lesions. There is a cavum velum interpositum (normal variant).

There is a linear area of T1 hypointensity becoming hyperintense on T2 images in a left para-atrial trigonal region representing either a remote lacunar infarction or prominent perivascular space.

Normal basal ganglia and thalami. Normal internal and external capsules. Normal midbrain.

There is amorphus hyperintensity of the basis pontis consistent with vasculopathic small vessel disease. There are areas of T2 hyperintensity involving the bilateral brachium pontis (left greater than right) with no enhancement following gadolinium augmentation most compatible with areas of chronic white matter ischemic changes. The area of white matter signal alteration in the left brachium pontis is of some concern in that is has a round morphology. Interval reassessment of this lesion is recommended.

There is a remote lacunar infarction of the right cerebellar hemisphere. Normal left cerebellar hemisphere and vermis.

There is increased CSF within the sella turcica and mild flattening of the pituitary gland but no sellar enlargement. There is elongation of the basilar artery elevating the mammary bodies but no dolichoectasia of the basilar artery.

Normal flow within the carotid arteries and circle of Willis.

Normal calvarium, central skull base and temporal bones.  There is no demonstrated calvarium metastases.

IMPRESSION:

Severe generalized cerebral atrophy.

Extensive chronic white matter ischemic changes in a bi-hemispheric centrum semiovale distribution with involvement of the basis pontis and probable bilateral brachium pontis. The area of white matter hyperintensity in the left brachium pontis is of some concern is that it has a round morphology but no enhancement following gadolinium augmentation. Interval reassessment of this lesion is recommended.

Remote lacunar infarction in the right cerebellar hemisphere.

Linear signal alteration of the left periatrial trigonal region representing either a prominent vascular space or

lacunar infarction.

No demonstrated calvarial metastases.

EXAM: 
 Two views of the soft tissues of the neck.

HISTORY:
  Patient has swelling of the left side of his neck.

TECHNIQUE:
  Frontal and lateral views of the soft tissues of the neck were evaluated. There were no soft tissues of the neck radiographs for comparison. However, there was an ultrasound of the neck performed on the same day.

FINDINGS: 
 Frontal and lateral views of the soft tissues of the neck were evaluated and reveal there is an asymmetry seen to the left-sided soft tissues of the patient's neck which appear somewhat enlarged when compared to patient's right side. However the trachea appears to be normal caliber and contour.  Lateral views show a patent airway. The adenoids and tonsils appear normal caliber without evidence of hypertrophy. Airway appears patent. Osseous structures appear grossly normal.

IMPRESSION:

1. Patent airway. No evidence of any soft tissue swelling involving the patient's adenoids/tonsils, epiglottis or aryepiglottic folds. No evidence of any prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
2. Slight asymmetry seen to the soft tissues of the left side of the patient's neck which appears somewhat larger when compared to the right side.

EXAM:  
Thoracic Spine.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Injury.

INTERPRETATION: 
 The thoracic spine was examined in the AP, lateral and swimmer's projections.  There is mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent T11 and 12 vertebral bodies.  A mild amount of anterior osteophytic lipping is seen involving the thoracic spine.  There is a suggestion of generalized osteoporosis.  The intervertebral disc spaces appear generally well preserved.

The pedicles appear intact.

IMPRESSION:

1. Mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent the T11 and 12 vertebral bodies.
2. Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
3. Osteoporosis.

EXAM: 
 CT pelvis with contrast and ct abdomen with and without contrast.

INDICATIONS:  
Abnormal liver enzymes and diarrhea.

TECHNIQUE: 
 CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after 100 mL of intravenous contrast administration and oral contrast administration.  Pre-contrast images through the abdomen were also obtained.

COMPARISON:  
There were no comparison studies.

FINDINGS:  
The lung bases are clear.

The liver demonstrates mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  These findings may be secondary to the patient's post cholecystectomy state.  The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.

There is a 13 mm peripheral-enhancing fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space of uncertain etiology.  There are numerous nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes.  These may be reactive; however, an early neoplastic process would be difficult to totally exclude.

There is a right inguinal hernia containing a loop of small bowel.  This may produce a partial obstruction as there is mild fluid distention of several small bowel loops, particularly in the right lower quadrant.  The large bowel demonstrates significant diverticulosis coli of the sigmoid and distal descending colon without evidence of diverticulitis.

There is diffuse osteopenia along with significant degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.

The urinary bladder is unremarkable.  The uterus is not visualized.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Right inguinal hernia containing small bowel.  Partial obstruction is suspected.
2.  Nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes.
3.  Thirteen millimeter of circumscribed fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space of uncertain etiology.
4.  Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
5.  Status post cholecystectomy with mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
6.  Osteopenia and degenerative changes of the spine and pelvis.

EXAM:
  Single frontal view of the chest.

HISTORY:
  Respiratory distress.  The patient has a history of malrotation.  The patient is back for a re-anastomosis of the bowel with no acute distress.

TECHNIQUE:
  Single frontal view of the chest was evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated MM/DD/YY.

FINDINGS:
  A single frontal view of the chest was evaluated.  It reveals interval placement of an ET tube and an NG tube.  ET tube is midway between the patient's thoracic inlet and carina.  NG tube courses with the distal tip in the left upper quadrant beneath the left hemidiaphragm.  There is no evidence of any focal areas of consolidation, pneumothoraces, or pleural effusions.  The mediastinum seen was slightly prominent; however, this may be secondary to thymus and/or technique.  There is a slight increase seen with regards to the central pulmonary vessels.  Again, this may represent a minimal amount of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is paucity of bowel gas seen in the upper abdomen.  The osseous thorax appears to be grossly intact and symmetrical.  Slightly low lung volumes, however, this may be secondary to the film being taken on the expiratory phase of respiration.

IMPRESSION:

1.  No evidence of any focal areas of consolidation, pneumothoraces, or pleural effusions.
2.  Slight prominence to the mediastinum which may be secondary to thymus and/or technique.
3.  Slight prominence of some of the central pulmonary vasculature which may represent a minimal amount of vascular congestion.

CC:
 Episodic monocular blindness, OS.

HX:
 This 29 y/o RHF was in her usual healthy state until 2 months prior to her 3/11/96 presentation when she developed episodic arthralgias of her knees and ankles, bilaterally. On 3/3/96, she experienced sudden onset monocular blindness, OS, lasting 5-10 minutes in duration. Her vision &quot;greyed out&quot; from the periphery to center of her visual field, OS; and during some episodes progressed to complete blindness (not even light perception). This resolved within a few minutes. She had multiple episodes of vision loss, OS, every day until 3/7/96 when she was placed on heparin for suspected LICA dissection. She saw a local ophthalmologist on 3/4/96 and was told she had a normal funduscopic exam. She experienced 0-1 spell of blindness (OS) per day from 3/7/96 to 3/11/96. In addition, she complained of difficulty with memory since 3/7/96. She denied dysarthria, aphasia or confusion, but had occasional posterior neck and bioccipital-bitemporal headaches.

She had no history of deep venous or arterial thrombosis.

3/4/96, ESR=123. HCT with and without contrast on 3/7/96 and 3/11/96, and Carotid Duplex scan were &quot;unremarkable.&quot; Rheumatoid factor=normal. 3-vessel cerebral angiogram (done locally) was reportedly &quot;unremarkable.&quot;

She was thought to have temporal arteritis and underwent Temporal Artery biopsy (which was unremarkable), She received Prednisone 80 mg qd for 2 days prior to presentation.

On admission she complained of a left temporal headache at the biopsy site, but no loss of vision or weakness

She had been experiencing mild fevers and chills for several weeks prior to presentation. Furthermore, she had developed cyanosis of the distal #3 toes on feet, and numbness and rash on the lateral aspect of her left foot. She developed a malar rash on her face 1-2 weeks prior to presentation.

MEDS:
 Depo-Provera, Prednisone 80mg qd, and Heparin IV.

Coord: unremarkable.

Sensory: decreased LT, PP, TEMP, along the lateral aspect of the left foot.

Gait: narrow-based and able to TT, HW and TW without difficulty.

Station: unremarkable.

Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally.

Skin: Cyanosis of the distal #3 toes on both feet. There was a reticular rash about the lateral aspect of her left foot. There were splinter-type hemorrhages under the fingernails of both hands.

COURSE: 
  ESR=108 (elevated), Hgb 11.3, Hct 33%, WBC 10.0, Plt 148k, MCV 92 (low) Cr 1.3, BUN 26, CXR and EKG were unremarkable. PTT 42 (elevated). PT normal. The rest of the GS and CBC were normal. Dilute Russell Viper venom time was elevated at 27 and a 1:1 prothrombin time mix corrected to only 36.

She was admitted to the Neurology service. Blood cultures were drawn and were negative. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography on 3/12/96 was unremarkable.

Her symptoms and elevated PTT suggested an ischemic syndrome involving anticardiolipin antibody and/or lupus anticoagulant. Her signs of rash and cyanosis suggested SLE. ANA was positive at 1:640 (speckled), RF (negative), dsDNA, 443 (elevated). Serum cryoglobulins were positive at 1% (fractionation data lost). Serum RPR was positive, but FTA-ABS was negative (thereby confirming a false-positive RPR). Anticardiolipin antibodies IgM and IgG were positive at 56.1 and 56.3 respectively. Myeloperoxidase antibody was negative, ANCA was negative and hepatitis screen unremarkable.

The Dermatology Service felt the patient's reticular foot rash was livedo reticularis. Rheumatology felt the patient met criteria for SLE. Hematology felt the patient met criteria for Anticardiolipin Antibody and/or Lupus anticoagulant Syndrome. Neurology felt the episodic blindness was secondary to thromboembolic events.

Serum Iron studies revealed: FeSat 6, Serum Fe 15, TIBC 237, Reticulocyte count 108.5. The patient was placed on FeSO4 225mg tid.

She was continued on heparin IV, but despite this she continued to have occasional episodes of left monocular blindness or &quot;gray outs&quot; up to 5 times per day. She was seen by the Neuro-ophthalmology Service. The did not think she had evidence of vasculitis in her eye. They recommended treatment with ASA 325mg bid. She was placed on this 3/15/96 and tapered off heparin. She continued to have 0-4 episodes of monocular blindness (OS) for 5-10 seconds per episodes. She was discharged home.

She returned 3/29/96 for episodic diplopia lasting 5-10 minutes per episode. The episodes began on 3/27/96. During the episodes her left eye deviated laterally while the right eye remained in primary gaze. She had no prior history of diplopia or strabismus. Hgb 10.1, Hct 30%, WBC 5.2, MCV 89 (low), Plt 234k. ESR 113mm/hr. PT 12, PTT 45 (high). HCT normal. MRI brain, 3/30/96, revealed a area of increased signal on T2 weighted images in the right frontal lobe white matter. This was felt to represent a thromboembolic event. She was place on heparin IV and treated with Solu-Medrol 125mg IV q12 hours. ASA was discontinued. Hematology, Rheumatology and Neurology agreed to place her on Warfarin. She was placed on Prednisone 60mg qd following the Solu-Medrol. She continued to have transient diplopia and mild vertigo despite INR's of 2.0-2.2. ASA 81mg qd was added to her regimen. In addition, Rheumatology recommended Plaquenil 200mg bid. The neurologic symptoms decreased gradually over the ensuing 3 days. Warfarin was increased to achieve INR 2.5-3.5.

She reported no residual symptoms or new neurologic events on her 5/3/96 Neurology Clinic follow-up visit. She continues to be event free on Warfarin according to her Hematology Clinic notes up to 12/96.

PROCEDURE NOTE:
  The patient was brought to the transesophageal echo laboratory after informed consent was obtained.  The patient was seen by Anesthesia for MAC anesthesia.  The patient's posterior pharynx was anesthetized with local Cetacaine spray.  The transesophageal probe was introduced into the posterior pharynx and esophagus without difficulty.

FINDINGS: 

1.  Left ventricle is normal in size and function; ejection fraction approximately 60%.
2.  Right ventricle is normal in size and function.
3.  Left atrium and right atrium are normal in size.

EXAM:
  Nuclear medicine tumor localization, whole body.

HISTORY: 
 Status post subtotal thyroidectomy for thyroid carcinoma, histology not provided.

FINDINGS: 
 Following the oral administration of 4.3 mCi Iodine-131, whole body planar images were obtained in the anterior and posterior projections at 24, 48, and 72 hours.

There is increased uptake in the left upper quadrant, which persists throughout the examination.  There is a focus of increased activity in the right lower quadrant, which becomes readily apparent at 72 hours.  Physiologic uptake in the liver, spleen, and transverse colon is noted.  Physiologic urinary bladder uptake is also appreciated.  There is low-grade uptake in the oropharyngeal region.

IMPRESSION:  
Iodine-avid foci in the right lower quadrant and left upper quadrant medially suspicious for distant metastasis.  Anatomical evaluation, i.e., CT is advised to determine if there are corresponding mesenteric lesions.  Ultimately (provided that the original pathology of the thyroid tumor with iodine-avid) PET scanning may be necessary.  No evidence of iodine added locoregional metastasis.

EXAM: 
 Screening full-field digital mammogram.

HISTORY:
  Screening examination of a 58-year-old female who currently denies complaints.  Patient has had diagnosis of right breast cancer in 1984 with subsequent radiation therapy.  The patient's sister was also diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 59.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Standard digital mammographic imaging was performed.  The examination was performed with iCAD Second Look Version 7.2.

COMPARISON: 
 Most recently obtained __________.

FINDINGS: 
 The right breast is again smaller than the left.  There is a scar marker with underlying skin thickening and retraction along the upper margin of the right breast.  The breasts are again composed of a mixture of adipose tissue and a moderate amount of heterogeneously-dense fibroglandular tissue.  There is again some coarsening of the right breast parenchyma with architectural distortion which is unchanged and most consistent with postsurgical and postradiation changes.  A few benign-appearing microcalcifications are present.

No dominant malignant-appearing mass lesion, developing area of architectural distortion or suspicious-appearing cluster of microcalcifications are identified.  The skin is stable.  No enlarged axillary lymph node is seen.

IMPRESSION:

1.  No significant interval changes are seen.  No mammographic evidence of malignancy is identified.
2.  Annual screening mammography is recommended or sooner if clinical symptoms warrant.

BIRADS Classification 2 - Benign

MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:

1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.
2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.
3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD Second Look Software Version 7.2 was utilized.

NUCLEAR MEDICINE HEPATOBILIARY SCAN

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Right upper quadrant pain.

COMPARISONS:  
CT of the abdomen dated 02/13/09 and ultrasound of the abdomen dated 02/13/09.

Radiopharmaceutical 6.9 mCi of Technetium-99m Choletec.

FINDINGS:
  Imaging obtained up to 30 minutes after the injection of radiopharmaceutical shows a normal hepatobiliary transfer time.  There is normal accumulation within the gallbladder.

After the injection of 2.1 mcg of intravenous cholecystic _______, the gallbladder ejection fraction at 30 minutes was calculated to be 32% (normal is greater than 35%).  The patient experienced 2/10 pain at 5 minutes after the injection of the radiopharmaceutical and the patient also complained of nausea.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Negative for acute cholecystitis or cystic duct obstruction.
2.  Gallbladder ejection fraction just under the lower limits of normal at 32% that can be seen with very mild chronic cholecystitis.

PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY - PROSTATE I-125 IMPLANTATION

This patient will be treated to the prostate with ultrasound-guided I-125 seed implantation.  The original consultation and treatment planning will be separately performed.  At the time of the implantation, special coordination will be required.  Stepping ultrasound will be performed and utilized in the pre-planning process.  Some discrepancies are frequently identified, based on the positioning, edema, and/or change in the tumor since the pre-planning process.  Re-assessment is required at the time of surgery, evaluating the pre-plan and comparing to the stepping ultrasound.  Modifications will be made in real time to add or subtract needles and seeds as required.  This may be integrated with the loading of the seeds performed by the brachytherapist, as well as coordinated with the urologist, dosimetrist or physicist.

The brachytherapy must be customized to fit the individual's tumor and prostate.  Attention is given both preoperatively and intraoperatively to avoid overdosage of rectum and bladder.

EXAM: 
 CT abdomen without contrast and pelvis without contrast, reconstruction.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Right lower quadrant pain, rule out appendicitis.

TECHNIQUE:  
Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis.  An intravenous line could not be obtained for the use of intravenous contrast material.

FINDINGS: 
 The appendix is normal.  There is a moderate amount of stool throughout the colon.  There is no evidence of a small bowel obstruction or evidence of pericolonic inflammatory process.  Examination of the extreme lung bases appear clear, no pleural effusions.  The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas appear normal given the lack of contrast.  There is a small hiatal hernia.  There is no intrarenal stone or evidence of obstruction bilaterally.  There is a questionable vague region of low density in the left anterior mid pole region, this may indicate a tiny cyst, but it is not well seen given the lack of contrast.  This can be correlated with a followup ultrasound if necessary.  The gallbladder has been resected.  There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy.  There is abdominal atherosclerosis without evidence of an aneurysm.

Dedicated scans of the pelvis disclosed phleboliths, but no free fluid or adenopathy.  There are surgical clips present.  There is a tiny airdrop within the bladder.  If this patient has not had a recent catheterization, correlate for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection.

IMPRESSION:

1.Normal appendix.
2.Moderate stool throughout the colon.
3.No intrarenal stones.
4.Tiny airdrop within the bladder.  If this patient has not had a recent catheterization, correlate for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection.  The report was faxed upon dictation.

GEN EXAM:
 notable for erythema of the face and chest.

COURSE:
 She underwent a total of four dives under Hyperbaric Oxygen ( 2 dives on 1/17 and 2 dives on 1/18). Neuropsychologic assessment on 1/18/96 revealed marked cognitive impairments with defects in anterograde memory, praxis, associative fluency, attention, and speed of information processing. She was discharged home on 1/19/96 and returned on 2/11/96 after neurologic deterioration. She progressively developed more illogical behavior, anhedonia, anorexia and changes in sleep pattern. She became completely dependent and could not undergo repeat neuropsychologic assessment in 2/96. She was later transferred to another care facility against medical advice. The etiology for these changes became complicated by a newly discovered history of possible ETOH abuse and usual &quot;anxiety&quot; disorder.

MRI brain, 2/14/96, revealed increased T2 signal within the periventricular white matter, bilaterally. EEG showed diffuse slowing without epileptiform activity.
        Your patient, (ABC), a 59-year-old female with no known coronary artery disease was referred to us for a CT coronary angiogram.  The patient's cardiac risk factors include chest discomfort, family history of coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia.  She is on no cardiac medications at the time of testing.  The patient's resting ECG demonstrated no ischemic changes.

CARDIAC CT INCLUDING CORONARY CT ANGIOGRAPHY

PROCEDURE: 
 Breath hold cardiac CT was performed using a 64-channel CT scanner with a 0.5-second rotation time.  Contrast injection was timed using a 10 mL bolus of Ultravist 370 IV.  Then the patient received 75 mL of Ultravist 370 at a rate of 5 mL/sec.

Retrospective ECG gating was performed.  The patient received 0.4 milligrams of sublingual nitroglycerin prior to the to the scan.  The average heart rate was 62 beats/min.

The patient had no adverse reaction to the contrast.  Multiphase retrospective reconstructions were performed.  Small field of view cardiac and coronary images were analyzed on a 3D work station.  Multiplanar reformatted images and 3D volume rendering was performed by the attending physician for the purpose of defining coronary anatomy and determining the extent of coronary artery disease.

CORONARY CTA:

1.  The technical quality of the scan is adequate.
2.  The coronary ostia are in their normal position.  The coronary anatomy is right dominant.
3.  LEFT MAIN:  The left main coronary artery is patent without angiographic stenosis.
4.  LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY:  The proximal aspect of the left anterior descending artery demonstrates a mixed plaque consisting of both calcified and noncalcified lesion which is less than 30% in stenosis severity.  Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 branches of the left anterior descending artery demonstrate mild irregularities.
5.  The ramus intermedius is a small vessel with minor irregularities.
6.  LEFT CIRCUMFLEX:  The left circumflex and obtuse marginal 1 and obtuse marginal 2 branches of the vessel are patent without significant stenosis.
7.  RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY:  The right coronary artery is a large and dominant vessel.  It demonstrates within its mid-segment calcified atherosclerosis, less than 50% stenosis severity.  Left ventricular ejection fraction is calculated to be 69%.  There are no wall motion abnormalities.
8.  Coronary calcium score was calculated to be 79, indicating at least mild atherosclerosis within the coronary vessels.

ANCILLARY FINDINGS: 
 None.

FINAL IMPRESSION:

1.  Mild coronary artery disease with a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction of 69%.
2.  Recommendation is aggressive medical management consisting of aggressive lifestyle modifications and statin therapy.

Thank you for referring this patient to us.

NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY/CARDIAC STRESS REPORT

INDICATION FOR STUDY: 
 Recurrent angina pectoris in a patient with documented ischemic heart disease and underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy.

PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was studied in the resting state following intravenous delivery of adenosine triphosphate at 140 mcg/kg/min delivered over a total of 4 minutes.  At completion of the second minute of infusion, the patient received technetium Cardiolite per protocol.  During this interval, the blood pressure 150/86 dropped to near 136/80 and returned to near 166/84 at completion.  No diagnostic electrocardiographic abnormalities were elaborated during this study.

REGIONAL MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION WITH ADENOSINE PROVOCATION: 
 Scintigraphic study reveals at this time multiple fixed defects in perfusion suggesting indeed multivessel coronary artery disease, yet no active ischemia at this time.  A fixed defect is seen in the high anterolateral segment.  A further fixed perfusion defect is seen in the inferoapical wall extending from close to the septum.  There is no evidence for active ischemia in either distribution.  Lateral wall moving towards the apex of the left ventricle is further involved from midway through the ventricle moving upward and into the high anterolateral vicinity.  When viewed from the vertical projection, the high septal wall is preserved with significant loss of the mid anteroapical wall moving to the apex and in a wraparound fashion in the inferoapical wall.  A limited segment of apical myocardium is still viable.

No gated wall motion study was obtained.

CONCLUSIONS:  
Cardiolite perfusion findings support multivessel coronary artery disease and likely previous multivessel infarct as has been elaborated above.  There is no indication for active ischemia at this time.
        This is a 30-year-old female with pain and swelling, status post injury.

FINDINGS:

There are posttraumatic cysts along the volar midline and volar lateral aspects of the lunate which are likely posttraumatic. There is no acute marrow edema (series #12 images #5-7). Marrow signal is otherwise normal in the distal radius and ulna, throughout the carpals and throughout the proximal metacarpals.

ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT)

The patient is to undergo a course of angioplasty for in-stent restenosis.  The radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site.  After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose given the reference vessel diameter.  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy.  The does per fraction is individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and reference vessel diameter.  Given that this is a very high dose rate source and the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function.

CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Generalized abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and recent colonic resection in 11/08.

TECHNIQUE:
  Axial CT images of the abdomen were obtained without contrast.  Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were then obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300.

FINDINGS: 
 The liver is normal in size and attenuation.

The gallbladder is normal.

The spleen is normal in size and attenuation.

The adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable.

The kidneys are normal in size and attenuation.

No hydronephrosis is detected.  Free fluid is seen within the right upper quadrant within the lower pelvis.  A markedly thickened loop of distal small bowel is seen.  This segment measures at least 10-cm long.  No definite pneumatosis is appreciated.  No free air is apparent at this time.  Inflammatory changes around this loop of bowel.  Mild distention of adjacent small bowel loops measuring up to 3.5 cm is evident.  No complete obstruction is suspected, as there is contrast material within the colon.  Postsurgical changes compatible with the partial colectomy are noted.  Postsurgical changes of the anterior abdominal wall are seen.  Mild thickening of the urinary bladder wall is seen.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Marked thickening of a segment of distal small bowel is seen with free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.  An inflammatory process such as infection or ischemia must be considered.  Close interval followup is necessary.
2.  Thickening of the urinary bladder wall is nonspecific and may be due to under distention.  However, evaluation for cystitis is advised.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Sequential axial CT images were obtained through the facial bones without contrast.  Additional high resolution coronal reconstructed images were also obtained for better visualization of the osseous structures.

FINDINGS:
  The osseous structures within the face are intact with no evidence of fracture or dislocation.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits.  The soft tissues are unremarkable.  

IMPRESSION: 
 No acute abnormalities.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Low Back Syndrome - Low Back Pain.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Same.

PROCEDURE:

1.  Bilateral facet Arthrogram at L34, L45, L5S1.
2.  Bilateral facet injections at L34, L45, L5S1.
3.  Interpretation of radiograph.

ANESTHESIA:  
IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
 None.

COMPLICATIONS:  
None.

INDICATION: 
 Pain in the lumbar spine secondary to facet arthrosis that was demonstrated by physical examination and verified with x-ray studies and imaging scans.

SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was admitted to the OR, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  Prior to sedation vitals signs were obtained and were continuously monitored throughout the procedure for amount of pain or changes in pain, EKG, respiration and heart rate and at intervals of three minutes for blood pressure.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.

The lumbar sacral regions were prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine prep and four sterile towels.

The facets in the lumbar regions were visualized with Fluoroscopy using an anterior posterior view.  A skin wheal was placed with 1% Lidocaine at the L34 facet region on the left.  Under fluoroscopic guidance a 22 gauge spinal needle was then placed into the L34 facet on the left side.  This was performed using the oblique view under fluoroscopy to the enable the view of the &quot;Scotty Dog,&quot; After obtaining the &quot;Scotty Dog&quot; view the joints were easily seen.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed to verity that there was no venous, arterial or cerebral spinal fluid flow.  After negative aspiration was verified, 1/8th of a cc of Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  Negative aspiration was again performed and 1/2 cc of solution (Solution consisting of 9 cc of 0.5% Marcaine with 1 cc of Triamcinolone) was then injected into the joint.  The needle was then withdrawn out of the joint and 1.5 cc of this same solution was injected around the joint.  The 22-gauge needle was then removed.  Pressure was place over the puncture site for approximately one minute.  This exact same procedure was then repeated along the left-sided facets at L45, and L5S1.  This exact same procedure was then repeated on the right side.  At each level, vigilance was carried out during the aspiration of the needle to verify negative flow of blood or cerebral spinal fluid.

The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.

Interpretation of the radiograph revealed placement of the 22-gauge spinal needles into the left-sided and right-sided facet joints at, L34, L45, and L5S1.  Visualizing the &quot;Scotty Dog&quot; technique under fluoroscopy facilitated this.  Dye spread into each joint space is visualized.  No venous or arterial run-off is noted.  No epidural run-off is noted.  The joints were noted to have chronic inflammatory changes noted characteristic of facet arthrosis.

CC: 
Progressive left visual field loss.

HX:
 This 46y/o RHF with polymyositis since 1988, presented with complaint of visual field loss since 12/94. The visual field loss was of gradual onset and within a month of onset became a left homonymous hemianopsia. She began experiencing stiffness, numbness, tingling and incoordination of her left hand, 6 weeks prior to this admission,. These symptoms were initially attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome. MRI scan of the brain (done locally) on 6/23/95 revealed increased periventricular white matter signal on T2 images, particularly in the left temporo-occipital and right parietal lobes. There was ring enhancement of a lesion in the left occipital lobe on T1 gadolinium contrast enhanced images. There was gyral enhancement near the right Sylvian fissure. Cerebral angiogram on 7/19/95 (done locally) was unremarkable. Lumbar puncture on 7/19/95 was unremarkable. She complained of frequent holocranial throbbing headaches for the past 6 months; the HA's are associated with photophobia, phonophobia and nausea, but no vomiting. She has also been experiencing chills and night sweats for the past 2-3 weeks. She denies weight loss, but acknowledged decreased appetite and increased generalized fatigue for the past 3-4 months.

She was diagnosed with polymyositis in 1988 with slowly progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness. She has been on immunosuppressive drugs since 1988, including Prednisone, Prednisone and methotrexate, Cyclosporin, Imuran, Cytoxan, and Plaquenil. At present she in ambulatory with use of walker. Her last CK=3,125 and ESR=16, on 6/28/95.

 Electrolytes, PT/PTT, Urinalysis and CXR were normal. ESR=38 (normal&lt;20), CRP1.4 (normal&lt;0.4). CK 2,917, LDH 356, AST 67. MRI Brain, 8/8/95, revealed slight improvement of the abnormal white matter changes seen on previous outside MRI. In addition new sphenoid sinus disease suggestive of sinusitis was seen. She underwent stereotactic biopsy of the right parietal region on 8/10/95 which on H&E and LFB stained sections revealed multiple discrete areas of demyelination, containing dense infiltrates of foamy macrophages in association with scattered large oligodendroglia with deeply basophilic, ground-glass nuclei, enlarged astrocytes, and sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. In situ hybridization performed on block A2 (at the university of Pittsburgh) is positive for JC virus. The ultrastructural studies demonstrated no viral particles.

She was tapered off all immunosuppressive medications and her polymyositis remained clinically stable. She had a seizure in 12/95 and was placed on Dilantin. Her neurologic deficits worsened slightly, but reached a plateau by 10/96, as indicated by a 4/14/97 Neurology clinic visit note.

1/22/96, MRI Brain demonstrated widespread hyperintense signal on T2 and Proton Density weighted images throughout the deep white matter in both hemispheres, worse on the right side. There was interval progression of previously noted abnormalities and extension into the right frontal and left parieto-occipital regions. There was progression of abnormal signal in the Basal Ganglia, worse on the right, and new involvement of the brainstem.

EXAM: 
 Chest PA & Lateral.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Shortness of breath, evaluate for pneumothorax versus left-sided effusion.

INTERPRETATION:  
There has been interval development of a moderate left-sided pneumothorax with near complete collapse of the left upper lobe.  The lower lobe appears aerated.  There is stable, diffuse, bilateral interstitial thickening with no definite acute air space consolidation.  The heart and pulmonary vascularity are within normal limits.  Left-sided port is seen with Groshong tip at the SVC/RA junction.  No evidence for acute fracture, malalignment, or dislocation.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Interval development of moderate left-sided pneumothorax with corresponding left lung atelectasis.
2.  Rest of visualized exam nonacute/stable.
3.  Left central line appropriately situated and stable.
4.  Preliminary report was issued at time of dictation.  Dr. X was called for results.

REASON FOR EXAM:  
Left arm and hand numbness.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained with 5 mm slice thickness.

FINDINGS:  
There is an approximately 5-mm shift of the midline towards the right side.  Significant low attenuation is seen throughout the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.  There is loss of the cortical sulci on the right side.  These findings are compatible with edema.  Within the right parietal lobe, a 1.8 cm, rounded, hyperintense mass is seen.

No hydrocephalus is evident.

The calvarium is intact.  The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION:  
A 5 mm midline shift to the left side secondary to severe edema of the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.  A 1.8 cm high attenuation mass in the right parietal lobe is concerning for hemorrhage given its high density.  A postcontrast MRI is required for further characterization of this mass.  Gradient echo imaging should be obtained.

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Generalized abdominal pain with swelling at the site of the ileostomy.

TECHNIQUE:
  Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300.

CT ABDOMEN:  
The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable.  Punctate calcifications in the gallbladder lumen likely represent a gallstone.

CT PELVIS:  
Postsurgical changes of a left lower quadrant ileostomy are again seen.  There is no evidence for an obstruction.  A partial colectomy and diverting ileostomy is seen within the right lower quadrant.  The previously seen 3.4 cm subcutaneous fluid collection has resolved.  Within the left lower quadrant, a 3.4 cm x 2.5 cm loculated fluid collection has not significantly changed.  This is adjacent to the anastomosis site and a pelvic abscess cannot be excluded.  No obstruction is seen.  The appendix is not clearly visualized.  The urinary bladder is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Resolution of the previously seen subcutaneous fluid collection.

EXAM:
MRI OF THE LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST

CLINICAL:
Left knee pain. Twisting injury.

FINDINGS:

The images reveal a sizable joint effusion. The joint effusion appears to be complex with mixed signal intensity material within. The patella is slightly laterally tilted towards the left. The mid portion of the patella cartilage shows some increased signal and focal injury to the patellar cartilage is suspected. Mildly increased bone signal overlying the inferolateral portion of the patella is identified. No significant degenerative changes about the patella can be seen. The quadriceps tendon as well as the infrapatellar ligament both look intact. There is some prepatellar soft tissue edema.

The bone signal shows a couple of small areas of cystic change in the proximal aspect of the tibia. NO significant areas of bone edema are appreciated.

There is soft tissue edema along the lateral aspect of the knee. There is a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. The medial collateral ligament complex looks intact. A small amount of edema is identified immediately adjacent to the medial collateral ligament complex.

The posterior cruciate ligament looks intact. The anterior cruciate ligament is thickened with significant increased signal. I suspect at least a high grade partial tear.

The posterior horn of the medial meniscus shows some myxoid degenerative changes. The posterior horn and anterior horn of the lateral meniscus likewise shows myxoid degenerative type changes. I don't see a definite tear extending to the articular surface.

IMPRESSION:

Sizeable joint effusion which is complex and may contain blood products.

Myxoid degenerative type changes medial and lateral meniscus with no definite evidence of a tear.

Soft tissue swelling and partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex.

At least high grade partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament with significant thickening and increased signal of this structure.

The posterior cruciate ligament is intact.

Injury to the patellar cartilage as above.

INDICATIONS:
  Previously markedly abnormal dobutamine Myoview stress test and gated scan.

PROCEDURE DONE:
  Resting Myoview perfusion scan and gated myocardial scan.

MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING:
  Resting myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging and gated scan were carried out with 32.6 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview.  Rest study was done and compared to previous dobutamine Myoview stress test done on Month DD, YYYY.  The lung heart ratio is 0.34.  There appears to be a moderate size inferoapical perfusion defect of moderate degree.  The gated myocardial scan revealed mild apical and distal inferoseptal hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 55%.

CONCLUSIONS:
  Study done at rest only revealed findings consistent with an inferior non-transmural scar of moderate size and moderate degree.  The left ventricular systolic function is markedly improved with much better regional wall motion of all left ventricular segments when compared to previous study done on Month DD, YYYY.  We cannot assess the presence of any reversible perfusion defects because no stress imaging was performed.

BIRADS Classification 2 - Benign

MAMMOGRAPHY INFORMATION:

1.  A certain percentage of cancers, probably 10% to 15%, will not be identified by mammography.
2.  Lack of radiographic evidence of malignancy should not delay a biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present.
3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD SecondLook Software Version 7.2 was utilized.

EXAM: 
 Carotid and cerebral arteriograms.

INDICATION: 
 Abnormal carotid duplex studies demonstrating occlusion of the left internal carotid artery.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery approximately 3 cm distal to its origin.
2.  Mild stenosis of the right internal carotid artery measured at 20%.
3.  Patent bilateral vertebral arteries.
4.  No significant disease was identified of the anterior cerebral vessels.

DISCUSSION:  
Carotid and cerebral arteriograms were performed on Month DD, YYYY, previous studies are not available for comparison.

The right groin was sterilely cleansed and draped.  Lidocaine 1% buffered with sodium bicarbonate was used as local anesthetic.  A 19-French needle was then advanced into the common femoral artery and a wire was advanced.  Over the wire, a sheath was placed.  A wire was then advanced into the abdominal aorta and over the wire and the flushed catheter was then advanced to the arch of the aorta over a wire.  Flushed arteriogram was performed.  Arteriogram demonstrated no significant disease of the great vessels at their origins.  There is demonstration of complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery approximately 3 cm distal to its origin.  The vertebral arteries were widely patent.  Following this, the flushed catheter was exchanged for ***** catheter and selective catheterization of the common carotid artery on the right was performed.  Carotid and cerebral arteriograms were performed.  The carotid arteriograms on the right demonstrated the carotid bulb to be unremarkable.  The external carotid artery on the right is quite tortuous in its appearance.  The internal carotid artery demonstrates a mild plaque creating stenosis, which is measured approximately 20%.  Cerebral arteriogram on the right demonstrated the A1 and M1 segments bilaterally to be normal.  No significant stenosis identified.  There is complete cross-filling into the left brain via the right.  No significant stenosis was appreciated.

Following this, the catheter was parked at the origin of the left common carotid artery and ejection demonstrated complete occlusion.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No complications occurred during or immediately after the procedure.  Stasis was achieved of the puncture site using a VasoSeal.  The patient will be observed for at least 2-1/2 hours prior to being discharged to home.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Vegetation and bacteremia.

PROCEDURE: 
 Transesophageal echocardiogram.

INTERPRETATION: 
 The procedure and its complications were explained to the patient in detail and formal consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to special procedure unit.  His throat was anesthetized with lidocaine spray.  Subsequently, 2 mg of IV Versed was given for sedation.  The patient was positioned.  Probe was introduced without any difficulty.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Normal left ventricular size and function.
2.  Echodensity involving the aortic valve suggestive of endocarditis and vegetation.
3.  Doppler study as above most pronounced being moderate-to-severe aortic insufficiency.

HISTORY: 
 The patient is a 56-year-old right-handed female with longstanding intermittent right low back pain, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in September of 2005.  At that time, she did not notice any specific injury.  Five days later, she started getting abnormal right low back pain.  At this time, it radiates into the buttocks down the posterior aspect of her thigh and into the right lateral aspect of her calf.  Symptoms are worse when sitting for any length of time, such as driving a motor vehicle.  Mild symptoms when walking for long periods of time.  Relieved by standing and lying down.  She denies any left leg symptoms or right leg weakness.  No change in bowel or bladder function.  Symptoms have slowly progressed.  She has had Medrol Dosepak and analgesics, which have not been very effective.  She underwent a spinal epidural injection, which was effective for the first few hours, but she had recurrence of the pain by the next day.  This was done four and a half weeks ago.

On examination, lower extremities strength is full and symmetric.  Straight leg raising is normal.

OBJECTIVE:
  Sensory examination is normal to all modalities.  Full range of movement of lumbosacral spine.  Mild tenderness over lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and sacroiliac joint.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the knees, 2 at the left ankle and 1+ at the right ankle.

NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:
  Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response, amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the lower extremities.  Right tibial H-reflex is slightly prolonged when compared to the left tibial H-reflex.

NEEDLE EMG:
  Needle EMG was performed in both lower extremities and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using the disposable concentric needle.  It revealed increased insertional activity in the right mid and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles as well as right peroneus longus muscle.  There were signs of chronic denervation in right tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, gastrocnemius medialis, and left gastrocnemius medialis muscles.

IMPRESSION: 
 This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:
1.  A mild right L5 versus S1 radiculopathy.
2.  Left S1 nerve root irritation.  There is no evidence of active radiculopathy.
3.  There is no evidence of plexopathy, myopathy or peripheral neuropathy.

MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals bilateral L5-S1 neuroforaminal stenosis, slightly worse on the right.  Results were discussed with the patient and her daughter.  I would recommend further course of spinal epidural injections with Dr. XYZ.  If she has no response, then surgery will need to be considered.  She agrees with this approach and will followup with you in the near future.

CC:
 Right shoulder pain.

HX: 
This 46 y/o RHF presented with a 4 month history of right neck and shoulder stiffness and pain. The symptoms progressively worsened over the 4 month course. 2 weeks prior to presentation she began to develop numbness in the first and second fingers of her right hand and RUE pain. The later was described as a throbbing pain. She also experienced numbness in both lower extremities and pain in the coccygeal region. The pains worsened at night and impaired sleep. She denied any visual change, bowel or bladder difficulties and symptoms involving the LUE. She occasionally experienced an electric shock like sensation shooting down her spine when flexing her neck (Lhermitte's phenomena). She denied any history of neck/back/head trauma.

She had been taking Naprosyn with little relief.

PMH: 
1) Catamenial Headaches. 2) Allergy to Macrodantin.

SHX/FHX:
 Smokes 2ppd cigarettes.

EXAM: 
Vital signs were unremarkable.

CN: unremarkable.

Motor: full strength throughout. Normal tone and muscle bulk.

Sensory: No deficits on LT/PP/VIB/TEMP/PROP testing.

Coord/Gait/Station: Unremarkable.

Reflexes: 2/2 in BUE except 2+ at left biceps. 1+/1+BLE except an absent right ankle reflex.

Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rectal exam: normal tone.

IMPRESSION:
 C-spine lesion.

COURSE: 
MRI C-spine revealed a central C5-6 disk herniation with compression of the spinal cord at that level. EMG/NCV showed normal NCV, but 1+ sharps and fibrillations in the right biceps (C5-6), brachioradialis (C5-6), triceps (C7-8) and teres major; and 2+ sharps and fibrillations in the right pronator terres. There was increased insertional activity in all muscles tested on the right side. The findings were consistent with a C6-7 radiculopathy.

The patient subsequently underwent C5-6 laminectomy and her symptoms resolved.

EXAM: 
 Ultrasound of pelvis.

HISTORY:
 Menorrhagia.

FINDINGS: 
 Uterus is enlarged measuring 11.0 x 7.5 x 11.0 cm.  It appears to be completely replaced by multiple ill-defined fibroids.  The endometrial echo complex was not visualized due to the contents of replacement of the uterus with fibroids.  The right ovary measures 3.9 x 1.9 x 2.3 cm.  The left ovary is not seen.  No complex cystic adnexal masses are identified.

IMPRESSION:  
Essential replacement of the uterus by fibroids.  It is difficult to measure given their heterogenous and diffuse nature.  MRI of the pelvis could be performed for further evaluation to evaluate for possible uterine fibroid embolization.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Aortic valve replacement.  Assessment of stenotic valve.  Evaluation for thrombus on the valve.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
Atrial valve replacement.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
  Moderate stenosis of aortic valve replacement.  Mild mitral regurgitation.  Normal left ventricular function.

PROCEDURES IN DETAIL: 
 The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits.  The patient agreed and signed the consent form.  The patient received a total of 3 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl for conscious sedation and pain control.  The oropharynx anesthetized with benzocaine spray and lidocaine solution.

Esophageal intubation was done with no difficulty with the second attempt.  In a semi-Fowler position, the probe was passed to transthoracic views at about 40 to 42 cm.  Multiple pictures obtained.  Assessment of the peak velocity was done later.

The probe was pulled to the mid esophageal level.  Different pictures including short-axis views of the aortic valve was done.  Extubation done with no problems and no blood on the probe.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedure complications.

INTERPRETATION: 
 The left atrium was mildly dilated.  No masses or thrombi were seen.  The left atrial appendage was free of thrombus.  Pulse wave interrogation showed peak velocities of 60 cm per second.

The left ventricle was normal in size and contractility with mild LVH.  EF is normal and preserved.

The right atrium and right ventricle were both normal in size.

Mitral valve showed no vegetations or prolapse.  There was mild-to-moderate regurgitation on color flow interrogation.  Aortic valve was well-seated mechanical valve, bileaflet with acoustic shadowing beyond the valve noticed.  No perivalvular leak was noticed.  There was increased velocity across the valve with peak velocity of 3.2 m/sec with calculated aortic valve area by continuity equation at 1.2 cm2 indicative of moderate aortic valve stenosis based on criteria for native heart valves.

No AIC.

Pulmonic valve was somewhat difficult to see because of acoustic shadowing from the aortic valve.  Overall showed no abnormalities.  The tricuspid valve was structurally normal.

Interatrial septum appeared to be intact, confirmed by color flow interrogation as well as agitated saline contrast study.

The aorta and aortic arch were unremarkable.  No dissection.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Mildly dilated left atrium.
2.  Mild-to-moderate regurgitation.
3.  Well-seated mechanical aortic valve with peak velocity of 3.2 m/sec and calculated valve area of 1.2 cm2 consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.  Reevaluation in two to three years with transthoracic echocardiogram will be recommended.
        This is a 34-year old female with no fetal heart motion noted on office scan.

There is a gestational sac within the endometrial cavity measuring 2.1cm consistent with 6 weeks 4 days. There is a fetal pole measuring 7mm consistent with 6 weeks 4 days. There was no fetal heart motion on Doppler or on color Doppler.

There is no fluid within the endometrial cavity.

There is a 2.8 x 1.2cm right adnexal cyst.

IMPRESSION:

Gestational sac with a fetal pole but no fetal heart motion consistent with fetal demise at 6 weeks 4 days. By dates the patient is 8 weeks, 2 days.

A preliminary report was called by the ultrasound technologist to the referring physician.
        This is a middle-aged female complaining of elbow pain.

FINDINGS:

There is severe tendinitis of the common extensor tendon origin with diffuse intratendinous inflammation (coronal T2 image #1452, sagittal T2 image #1672). There is irregularity of the deep surface of the tendon consistent with mild fraying (#1422 and 1484) however there is no distinct tear.

There is a joint effusion of the radiocapitellar articulation with mild fluid distention.

The radial collateral (proper) ligament remains intact. There is periligamentous inflammation of the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (coronal T2 image #1484) of the radial collateral ligamentous complex. There is no articular erosion or osteochondral defect with no intra-articular loose body.

There is minimal inflammation of the subcutis adipose space extending along the origin of the common flexor tendon (axial T2 image #1324). The common flexor tendon otherwise is normal.

Minimal periligamentous inflammation of the anterior band of the ulnar collateral ligament with an intrinsically normal ligament.

HYPERFRACTIONATION

This patient is to undergo a course of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of known malignancy.  The radiotherapy will be given in a hyperfractionated fraction (decreased dose per fraction but 2 fractions delivered daily separated by a period of at least 6 hours).  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiologic principles that make this type of therapy more effective in rapidly growing, previously irradiated or poorly oxygenated tumors.  The dose per fraction and the total dose are calculated by me, and this is individualized for each patient according to radiobiologic principles.

During the hyperfractionated radiotherapy, the chance of severe acute side effects is increased, so the patient will be followed more intensively for the development of any side effects and treatment instituted accordingly.

2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM

Multiple views of the heart and great vessels reveal normal intracardiac and great vessel relationships.  Cardiac function is normal.  There is no significant chamber enlargement or hypertrophy.  There is no pericardial effusion or vegetations seen.  Doppler interrogation, including color flow imaging, reveals systemic venous return to the right atrium with normal tricuspid inflow.  Pulmonary outflow is normal at the valve.  Pulmonary venous return is to the left atrium.  The interatrial septum is intact.  Mitral inflow and ascending aorta flow are normal.  The aortic valve is trileaflet.  The coronary arteries appear to be normal in their origins.  The aortic arch is left-sided and patent with normal descending aorta pulsatility.

INDICATION:
  Prostate Cancer.

TECHNIQUE:
  3.5 hours following the intravenous administration of 26.5 mCi of Technetium 99m MDP, the skeleton was imaged in the anterior and posterior projections.

FINDINGS:
  There is a focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull.  The uptake in the remainder of the skeleton is within normal limits.  The kidneys image normally.  There is increased activity in the urinary bladder suggesting possible urinary retention.

CONCLUSION:

1.  Focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull.  CT scanning of magnetic resonance imaging of the skull and brain could be done for further assessment if it is clinically indicated.
2.  There is probably some degree of urinary retention.


PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Ovarian cyst, persistent.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Ovarian cyst.

ANESTHESIA:
  General

NAME OF OPERATION:
  Diagnostic laparoscopy and drainage of cyst.

PROCEDURE:
  The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the usual manner, and adequate anesthesia was induced.  An infraumbilical incision was made, and Veress needle placed without difficulty.  Gas was entered into the abdomen at two liters.  The laparoscope was entered, and the abdomen was visualized.  The second puncture site was made, and the second trocar placed without difficulty.  The cyst was noted on the left, a 3-cm, ovarian cyst.  This was needled, and a hole cut in it with the scissors.  Hemostasis was intact.  Instruments were removed.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.

LEXISCAN MYOVIEW STRESS STUDY

REASON FOR THE EXAM: 
 Chest discomfort.

INTERPRETATION: 
 The patient exercised according to the Lexiscan study, received a total of 0.4 mg of Lexiscan IV injection.  At peak hyperemic effect, 24.9 mCi of Myoview were injected for the stress imaging and earlier 8.2 mCi were injected for the resting and the usual SPECT and gated SPECT protocol was followed and the data was analyzed using Cedars-Sinai software.  The patient did not walk because of prior history of inability to exercise long enough on treadmill.

The resting heart rate was 57 with the resting blood pressure 143/94.  Maximum heart rate achieved was 90 with a maximum blood pressure unchanged.

EKG at rest showed sinus rhythm with no significant ST-T wave changes of reversible ischemia or injury.  Subtle nonspecific in III and aVF were seen.  Maximum stress test EKG showed inverted T wave from V4 to V6.  Normal response to Lexiscan.

CONCLUSION:  
Maximal Lexiscan perfusion with subtle abnormalities non-conclusive.  Please refer to the Myoview interpretation.

MYOVIEW INTERPRETATION: 
 The left ventricle appeared to be normal in size on both stress and rest with no change between the stress and rest with left ventricular end-diastolic volume of 115 and end-systolic of 51.  EF estimated and calculated at 56%.

Cardiac perfusion reviewed, showed no reversible defect indicative of myocardium risk and no fixed defect indicative of myocardial scarring.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Normal stress/rest cardiac perfusion with no indication of ischemia.
2.  Normal LV function and low likelihood of significant epicardial coronary narrowing.


NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:
  Bilateral ulnar sensory responses are absent.  Bilateral median sensory distal latencies are prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude.  The left radial sensory response is normal and robust.  Left sural response is absent.  Left median motor distal latency is prolonged with attenuated evoked response amplitude.  Conduction velocity across the forearm is mildly slowed.  Right median motor distal latency is prolonged with a normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity.  The left ulnar motor distal latency is prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude both below and above the elbow.  Conduction velocities across the forearm and across the elbow are prolonged.  Conduction velocity proximal to the elbow is normal.  The right median motor distal latency is normal with normal evoked response amplitudes at the wrist with a normal evoked response amplitude at the wrist.  There is mild diminution of response around the elbow.  Conduction velocity slows across the elbow.  The left common peroneal motor distal latency evoked response amplitude is normal with slowed conduction velocity across the calf and across the fibula head.  F-waves are prolonged.

NEEDLE EMG: 
 Needle EMG was performed on the left arm and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles as well as middle thoracic muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It revealed spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, left abductor pollicis brevis, and first dorsal interosseous muscles.  There were signs of chronic reinnervation in triceps, extensor digitorum communis, flexor pollicis longus as well first dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis muscles.

IMPRESSION: 
 This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:
1.  A sensory motor length-dependent neuropathy consistent with diabetes.
2.  A severe left ulnar neuropathy.  This is probably at the elbow, although definitive localization cannot be made.
3.  Moderate-to-severe left median neuropathy.  This is also probably at the carpal tunnel, although definitive localization cannot be made.
4.  Right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, mild.
5.  Right median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, moderate.
6.  A left C8 radiculopathy (double crush syndrome).
7.  There is no evidence for thoracic radiculitis.

The patient has made very good response with respect to his abdominal pain since starting Neurontin.  He still has mild allodynia and is waiting for authorization to get insurance coverage for his Lidoderm patch.  He is still scheduled for MRI of C-spine and T-spine.  I will see him in followup after the above scans.

EXAM:
  Echocardiogram.

INDICATION: 
 Aortic stenosis.

INTERPRETATION: 
 Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed of adequate technical quality.  Left ventricle reveals concentric hypertrophy with normal size and dimensions and normal function.  Ejection fraction is 60% without any obvious wall motion abnormality.  Left atrium and right side chambers are of normal size and dimensions.  Aortic root has normal diameter.

Mitral and tricuspid valves are structurally normal except for minimal annular calcification.  Valvular leaflet excursion is adequate.  Aortic valve reveals annular calcification.  Fibrocalcific valve leaflets with decreased excursion.  Atrial and ventricular septum are intact.  Pericardium is intact without any effusion.  No obvious intracardiac mass or thrombi noted.

Doppler reveals mild mitral regurgitation, mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.  Estimated pulmonary pressure of 48.  Systolic consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Peak velocity across the aortic valve is 3.0 with a peak gradient of 37, mean gradient of 19, valve area calculated at 1.1 sq. cm consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.

IN SUMMARY:

1. Concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle with normal function.

CC: 
Difficulty with speech.

HX:
 This 72 y/o RHM awoke early on 8/14/95 to prepare to play golf. He felt fine. However, at 6:00AM, on 8/14/95, he began speaking abnormally. His wife described his speech as &quot;word salad&quot; and &quot;complete gibberish.&quot; She immediately took him to a local hospital . Enroute, he was initially able to understand what was spoken to him. By the time he arrived at the hospital at 6:45AM, he was unable to follow commands. His speech was reportedly unintelligible the majority of the time, and some of the health care workers thought he was speaking a foreign language. There were no other symptoms or signs. He had no prior history of cerebrovascular disease. Blood pressure 130/70 and Pulse 82 upon admission to the local hospital on 8/14/95.

Evaluation at the local hospital included: 1)HCT scan revealed an old left putaminal hypodensity, but no acute changes or evidence of hemorrhage, 2) Carotid Duplex scan showed ICA stenosis of 40%, bilaterally. He was placed on heparin and transferred to UIHC on 8/16/95.

In addition, he had noted memory and word finding difficulty for 2 months prior to presentation. He had undergone a gastrectomy 16 years prior for peptic ulcer disease. His local physician found him vitamin B12 deficient and he was placed on vitamin B12 and folate supplementation 2 months prior to presentation. He and his wife felt that this resulted in improvement of his language and cognitive skills.

MEDS:
 Heparin IV, Vitamin B12 injection q. week, Lopressor, Folate, MVI.

EXAM:
 BP 110/70, HR 50, RR 14, Afebrile.

MS: A&O to person and place, but not time. Oral comprehension was poor beyond the simplest of conversational phrases. Speech was fluent, but consisted largely of &quot;word salad.&quot; When asked how he was, he replied: &quot;abadeedleedlebadle.&quot; Repetition was defective, especially with long phrases. On rare occasions, he uttered short comments appropriately. Speech was marred by semantic and phonemic paraphasias. He named colors and described most actions well, although he described a &quot;faucet dripping&quot; as a &quot;faucet drop.&quot; He called &quot;red&quot; &quot;reed.&quot; Reading comprehension was better than aural comprehension. He demonstrated excellent written calculations. Spoken calculations were accurate except when the calculations became more complex. For example, he said that ten percent of 100 was equal to &quot;1,200.&quot;

CN: Pupils 2/3 decreasing to 1/1 on exposure to light. VFFTC. There were no field cuts or evidence of visual neglect. EOM were intact. Face moved symmetrically. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable.

Transesophageal echocardiogram on 8/18/95 revealed a sclerotic aortic valve and myxomatous degeneration of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. LAE 4.8cm, and spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium were noted. There was no evidence of intracardiac shunt or clot. Carotid duplex scan on 8/16/95 revealed 0-15% BICA stenosis with anterograde vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Neuropsychologic testing revealed a Wernicke's aphasia.

The impression was that the patient had had a cardioembolic stroke involving a lower-division branch of the left MCA. He was subsequently placed on warfarin. Thoughout his hospital stay he showed continued improvement of language skills and was enrolled in speech therapy following discharge, 8/21/95.

He has had no further stroke like episodes up until his last follow-up visit in 1997.

EXAM:
MRI CERVICAL SPINE

CLINICAL:
 A57-year-old male. Received for outside consultation is an MRI examination performed on 11/28/2005.

FINDINGS:

Normal brainstem-cervical cord junction. Normal cisterna magna with no tonsillar ectopia. Normal clivus with a normal craniovertebral junction. Normal anterior atlantoaxial articulation.

C2-3: Normal intervertebral disc with no spondylosis or uncovertebral joint arthrosis. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina with no cord or radicular impingement.

C3-4: There is disc desiccation with minimal annular bulging. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 10mm. CSF remains present surrounding the cord.

C4-5: There is disc desiccation with endplate spondylosis and mild uncovertebral joint arthrosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures approximately 8mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft producing a borderline central canal stenosis but no cord distortion or cord edema. There is minimal uncovertebral joint arthrosis.

C5-6: There is disc desiccation with minimal posterior annular bulging and a right posterolateral preforaminal disc protrusion measuring approximately 2 x 8mm (AP x transverse). The disc protrusion produces minimal rightward ventral thecal sac flattening but no cord impingement.

C6-7: There is disc desiccation with mild loss of disc space height and posterior endplate spondylosis and annular bulging producing central canal stenosis. The residual AP diameter of the central canal measures 8 mm with effacement of the circumferential CSF cleft. There is a left posterolateral disc-osteophyte complex encroaching upon the left intervertebral neural foramen with probable radicular impingement upon the exiting left C7 nerve root.

Normal cervical cord.

PROCEDURE:  
This tracing was obtained utilizing silver chloride biopotential electrodes placed at the medial and lateral canthi at both eyes and on the superior and inferior orbital margins of the left eye along a vertical line drawn through the middle of the pupil in the neutral forward gaze.  Simultaneous recordings were made in both eyes in the horizontal direction and the left eye in the vertical directions.  Caloric irrigations were performed using a closed loop irrigation system at 30 degrees and 44 degrees C into either ear.

FINDINGS: 
 Gaze testing did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.  Saccadic movements did not reveal any evidence of dysmetria or overshoot.  Sinusoidal tracking was performed well for the patient's age.  Optokinetic nystagmus testing was performed poorly due to the patient's difficulty in following the commands.  Therefore adequate OKNs were not achieved.  The Dix-Hallpike maneuver in the head handing left position resulted in moderate intensity left beating nystagmus, which was converted to a right beating nystagmus when she sat up again.  The patient complained of severe dizziness in this position.  There was no clear-cut decremental response with repetition.  In the head hanging left position, no significant nystagmus was identified.  Positional testing in the supine, head hanging, head right, head left, right lateral decubitus, and left lateral decubitus positions did not reveal any evidence of nystagmus.

Caloric stimulation revealed a calculated unilateral weakness of 7.0% on the right (normal &lt;20%) and left beating directional preponderance of 6.0% (normal &lt;20-30%).

IMPRESSION: 
 Abnormal electronystagmogram demonstrating prominent nystagmus on position testing in the head hanging right position.  No other significant nystagmus was noted.  There was no evidence of clear-cut caloric stimulation abnormality.  This study would be most consistent with a right vestibular dysfunction.

CC:
 Sudden onset blindness.

HX:
 This 58 y/o RHF was in her usual healthy state, until 4:00PM, 1/8/93, when she suddenly became blind. Tongue numbness and slurred speech occurred simultaneously with the loss of vision. The vision transiently improved to &quot;severe blurring&quot; enroute to a local ER, but worsened again once there. While being evaluated she became unresponsive, even to deep noxious stimuli. She was transferred to UIHC for further evaluation. Upon arrival at UIHC her signs and symptoms were present but markedly improved.

        Recent diagnosis of left breast cancer. Evaluate malignancy. Bilateral breast MRI with & without IV contrast comparison study performed on 8/24/07 and 8/29/07.

FINDINGS:

There are post biopsy changes seen in the retroareolar region, middle third aspect of the left breast at the post biopsy site.

There is abnormal enhancement seen in this location compatible with patient history of malignancy.

There is increased enhancement seen in the inferior aspect of the left breast at the 6:00 o'clock, N+5.5 cm position measuring 1.2 cm. Further work-up with ultrasound is indicated.

There are other multiple benign appearing enhancing masses seen in both the right and left breasts.

None of the remaining masses appear worrisome for malignancy based upon MRI criteria.

IMPRESSION:
  BIRADS CATEGORY M/5

There is a malignant appearing area of enhancement in the left breast which does correspond to the patient history of recent diagnosis of malignancy.

She has been scheduled to see a surgeon, as well as Medical Oncologist.

Dedicated ultrasonography of the inferior aspect of the left breast should be performed at the 6:00 o'clock, N+5.5 cm position for further evaluation of the mass. At that same time, ultrasonography of the remaining masses should also be performed.

Please note, however that the remaining masses have primarily benign features based upon MRI criteria. However, further evaluation with ultrasound should be performed.

EXAM:
  CT Abdomen & Pelvis W&WO Contrast
REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Status post aortobiiliac graft repair. 
TECHNIQUE: 
 5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement.  No oral or rectal contrast was utilized.  Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05.  There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP.  Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips.  The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen.  There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak.  Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either.  No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level.  There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present.  The findings are unchanged from the prior exam.  

The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present.  There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney.  No hydronephrosis is present.  No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen. 

The lung bases are clear. 

Concerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified.  There is prominent streak artifact from the left total hip replacement.  There is diffuse moderate sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.  The bladder grossly appears normal.  A hysterectomy has been performed.  

IMPRESSION:

1.  No complications identified regarding endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair as described.  The findings are stable compared to the study of 10/20/04.  
2.  Stable mild aneurysm of aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at renal artery level.  
3.  No other acute findings noted. 
4.  Advanced left renal atrophy.

CC: 
Low Back Pain (LBP) with associated BLE weakness.

HX:
 This 75y/o RHM presented with a 10 day h/o progressively worsening LBP. The LBP started on 12/3/95; began radiating down the RLE, on 12/6/95; then down the LLE, on 12/9/95. By 12/10/95, he found it difficult to walk. On 12/11/95, he drove himself to his local physician, but no diagnosis was rendered. He was given some NSAID and drove home. By the time he got home he had great difficulty walking due to LBP and weakness in BLE, but managed to feed his pets and himself. On 12/12/95 he went to see a local orthopedist, but on the way to his car he crumpled to the ground due to BLE weakness and LBP pain. He also had had BLE numbness since 12/11/95. He was evaluated locally and an L-S-Spine CT scan and L-S Spine X-rays were &quot;negative.&quot; He was then referred to UIHC.

The differential diagnosis included Amyotrophy, Polymyositis, Epidural hematoma, Disc Herniation and Guillain-Barre syndrome. An MRI of the lumbar spine was obtained, 12/13/95. This revealed an L3-4 disc herniation extending inferiorly and behind the L4 vertebral body. This disc was located more on the right than on the left , compromised the right neural foramen, and narrowed the spinal canal. The patient underwent a L3-4 laminectomy and diskectomy and subsequently improved. He was never seen in follow-up at UIHC.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 A 68-year-old white male with recently diagnosed adenocarcinoma by sputum cytology.  An abnormal chest radiograph shows right middle lobe infiltrate and collapse.  Patient needs staging CT of chest with contrast.  Right sided supraclavicular and lower anterior cervical adenopathy noted on physical exam.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Multiple transaxial images utilized in 10 mm sections were obtained through the chest.  Intravenous contrast was administered.

FINDINGS: 
 There is a large 3 x 4 cm lymph node seen in the right supraclavicular region.  There is a large right paratracheal lymph node best appreciated on image #16 which measures 3 x 2 cm.  A subcarinal lymph node is enlarged also.  It measures 6 x 2 cm.  Multiple pulmonary nodules are seen along the posterior border of the visceral as well as parietal pleura.  There is a pleural mass seen within the anterior sulcus of the right hemithorax as well as the right crus of the diaphragm.  There is also a soft tissue density best appreciated on image #36 adjacent to the inferior aspect of the right lobe of the liver which most likely also represents metastatic deposit.  The liver parenchyma is normal without evidence of any dominant masses.  The right kidney demonstrates a solitary cyst in the mid pole of the right kidney.

CC:
 Headache

HX: 
This 16 y/o RHF was in good health, until 11:00PM, the evening of 11/27/87, when she suddenly awoke from sleep with severe headache. Her parents described her as holding her head between her hands. She had no prior history of severe headaches. 30 minutes later she felt nauseated and vomited. The vomiting continued every 30 minutes and she developed neck stiffness. At 2:00AM on 11/28/97, she got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed in her mother's arms. Her mother noted she appeared weak on the left side. Shortly after this she experienced fecal and urinary incontinence. She was taken to a local ER and transferred to UIHC.

Coordination: left sided weakness evident.

Station: left pronator drift.

Gait: left hemiparesis.

Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. No clonus. Plantars were flexor bilaterally.

Gen Exam: unremarkable.

COURSE: 
The patient underwent emergent CT Brain. This revealed a perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage and contrast enhancing structures in the medial aspect of the parietotemporal region. She then underwent a 4-vessel cerebral angiogram. This study was unremarkable except for delayed transit of the contrast material through the vascular system of the brain and poor opacification of the straight sinus. This suggested straight sinus thromboses. MRI Brain was then done; this was unremarkable and did not show sign of central venous thrombosis. CBC/Blood Cx/ESR/PT/PTT/GS/CSF Cx/ANA were negative.

Lumbar puncture on 12/1/87 revealed an opening pressure of 55cmH20, RBC18550, WBC25, 18neutrophils, 7lymphocytes, Protein25mg/dl, Glucose47mg/dl, Cx negative.

The patient was assumed to have had a SAH secondary to central venous thrombosis due to oral contraceptive use. She recovered well, but returned to Neurology at age 32 for episodic blurred vision and lightheadedness. EEG was compatible with seizure tendency (right greater than left theta bursts from the mid-temporal regions), and she was recommended an anticonvulsant which she refused.
        A survey film of the abdomen shows no soft tissue abnormalities and no pathologic calcifications overlying the renal contours or bladder.  Following intravenous infusion of appropriate contrast material, there is prompt symmetrical concentration as noted by nephrograms.  No filling defects of the collecting systems are noted on the linear tomograms.

There is normal and symmetrical filling of the caliceal system.  Subsequent films demonstrate that the kidneys are of normal size and contour bilaterally.  The caliceal system and ureters are in their usual position and show no signs of obstruction or intraluminal defects. The postvoid films demonstrate normal emptying of the collecting system, including the urinary bladder.

IMPRESSION:
  Negative intravenous urogram.


EXAM: 
 Ultrasound carotid, bilateral.

REASON FOR EXAMINATION: 
 Pain.

COMPARISON:
  None.

FINDINGS: 
 Bilateral common carotid arteries/branches demonstrate minimal, predominantly noncalcified plaquing with mild calcific plaquing in the left internal carotid artery.  There are no different colors or spectral Doppler waveform abnormalities.

PARAMETRIC DATA:
  Right CCA PSV 0.72 m/s.  Right ICA PSV is 0.595 m/s.  Right ICA EDV 0.188 m/s.  Right vertebral 0.517 m/s. Right IC/CC is 0.826. Left CCA PSV 0.571 m/s, left ICA PSV 0.598 m/s.  Left ICA EDV 0.192 m/s.  Left vertebral 0.551 m/s.  Left IC/CC is 1.047.

IMPRESSION:

1.  No evidence for clinically significant stenosis.
2.  Minimal, predominantly soft plaquing.


EXAM: 
 Transvaginal ultrasound.

HISTORY: 
 Pelvic pain.

FINDINGS: 
 The right ovary measures 1.6 x 3.4 x 2.0 cm.  There are several simple-appearing probable follicular cysts. There is no abnormal flow to suggest torsion on the right.  Left ovary is enlarged, demonstrating a 6.0 x 3.5 x 3.7 cm complex cystic mass of uncertain etiology.  This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst versus abscess.  There is no evidence for left ovarian torsion.  There is a small amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac likely physiologic.

The uterus measures 7.7 x 5.0 cm.  The endometrial echo is normal at 6 mm.

IMPRESSION:

1.  No evidence for torsion.
2.  Large, complex cystic left ovarian mass as described.  This could represent a large hemorrhagic cyst; however, an abscess/neoplasm cannot be excluded.  Recommend either short interval followup versus laparoscopic evaluation given the large size and complex nature.
        This is a middle-aged female with moderate pain, severe swelling and a growth on the arm which is reportedly enlarging with limited range of motion for three months.

FINDINGS:

There is diffuse subcutis space edema extending along the posteromedial aspect of the elbow adjacent to the medial epicondyle, extending to the olecranon process and along the superficial aspect of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. There is no demonstrated solid, cystic or lipomatous mass lesion. There is enlargement with hyperintense signal of the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel. There is inflammation with mild laxity of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. The combined findings are most consistent with a ulnar nerve neuritis possibly secondary to a subluxing ulnar nerve however the ulnar nerve at this time is within the cubital tunnel. There is no accessory muscle within the cubital tunnel. The common flexor tendon origin is normal.

Normal ulnar collateral ligamentous complex.

3.  These images were obtained with FDA-approved digital mammography equipment, and iCAD Second Look Software Version 7.2 was utilized.

PROCEDURE: 
 Radiofrequency thermocoagulation of bilateral lumbar sympathetic chain.

ANESTHESIA: 
 Local sedation.

VITAL SIGNS: 
 See nurse's notes.

COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.

DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  
INT was placed.  The patient was in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Lidocaine 1.5% for skin wheal was made 10 cm from the midline to the bilateral L2 distal vertebral body.  A 20-gauge, 15 cm SMK needle was then directed using AP and fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip of the needle was noted to be along the distal one-third and anterior border on the lateral view and on the AP view the tip of the needle was inside the lateral third of the border of the vertebral body.  At this time a negative motor stimulation was obtained.  Injection of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plus 10 mg of Depo-Medrol was performed. Coagulation was then carried out for 90oC for 90 seconds.  At the conclusion of this, the needle under fluoroscopic guidance was withdrawn approximately 5 mm where again a negative motor stimulation was obtained and the sequence of injection and coagulation was repeated.  This was repeated one more time with a 5 mm withdrawal and coagulation.

At that time, attention was directed to the L3 body where the needle was placed to the upper one-third/distal two-thirds junction and the sequence of injection, coagulation, and negative motor stimulation with needle withdrawal one time of a 5 mm distance was repeated.  There were no compilations from this.  The patient was discharged to operating room recovery in stable condition.
        This is a middle-aged female with an enlarging mass of the left parotid region.

FINDINGS:

There is a well demarcated mass lesion of the deep lobe of the left parotid gland measuring approximately 2.4 X 3.9 X 3.0cm (AP X transverse X craniocaudal) in size. The lesion is well demarcated. There is a solid peripheral rim with a mean attenuation coefficient of 56.3. There is a central cystic appearing area with a mean attenuation coefficient of 28.1 HU, suggesting an area of central necrosis. There is the suggestion of mild peripheral rim enhancement. This large lesion within the deep lobe of the parotid gland abuts and effaces the facial nerve. Primary consideration is of a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), however, other solid mass lesions cannot be excluded, for which histologic evaluation would be necessary for definitive diagnosis. The right parotid gland is normal.

There is mild enlargement of the left jugulodigastric node, measuring 1.1cm in size, with normal morphology (image #33/68). There is mild enlargement of the right jugulodigastric node, measuring 1.2cm in size, with normal morphology (image #38/68).

There are demonstrated bilateral deep lateral cervical nodes at the midlevel, measuring 0.6cm on the right side and 0.9cm on the left side (image #29/68). There is a second midlevel deep lateral cervical node demonstrated on the left side (image #20/68), measuring 0.7cm in size. There are small bilateral low level nodes involving the deep lateral cervical nodal chain (image #15/68) measuring 0.5cm in size.

There is no demonstrated nodal enlargement of the spinal accessory or pretracheal nodal chains.

The right parotid gland is normal and there is no right parotid gland mass lesion.

Normal bilateral submandibular glands.

Normal parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal and perivertebral spaces.

Normal carotid spaces.

IMPRESSION:

Large, well demarcated mass lesion of the deep lobe of the left parotid gland, with probable involvement of the left facial nerve. See above for size, morphology and pattern enhancement. Primary consideration is of a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), however, other solid mass lesions cannot be excluded, for which histologic evaluation is necessary for specificity.

Multiple visualized nodes of the bilateral deep lateral cervical nodal chain, within normal size and morphology, most compatible with mild hyperplasia.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Chest pain, shortness of breath and cough, evaluate for pulmonary arterial embolism.

TECHNIQUE:  
Axial CT images of the chest were obtained for pulmonary embolism protocol utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300.

FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence for pulmonary arterial embolism.

The lungs are clear of any abnormal airspace consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  No abnormal mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen.

Limited images of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.  No destructive osseous lesion is detected.

IMPRESSION: 
 Negative for pulmonary arterial embolism.

EXAM:

1.  Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.
2.  Transcatheter infusion of papaverine.

ANESTHESIA: 
 General anesthesia

FLUORO TIME: 
 19.5 minutes

CONTRAST:
  Visipaque-270, 100 mL

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: 
 The patient is a 13-year-old boy who had clipping for a left ICA bifurcation aneurysm.  He was referred for a routine postop check angiogram.  He is doing fine clinically.  All questions were answered, risks explained, informed consent taken and patient was brought to angio suite.

TECHNIQUE: 
 After informed consent was taken patient was brought to angio suite, both groin sites were prepped and draped in sterile manner.  Patient was placed under general anesthesia for entire duration of the procedure.  Groin access was obtained with a stiff micropuncture wire and a 4-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush.  A 4-French angled Glide catheter was then taken up into the descending thoracic aorta was double flushed and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush.  The catheter was then taken up into the aortic arch and both common and internal carotid arteries were selectively catheterized followed by digital subtraction imaging in multiple projections.  The images showed spasm of the left internal carotid artery and the left A1, it was thought planned to infused papaverine into the ICA and the left A1.  After that the diagnostic catheter was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery.  SL-10 microcatheter was then prepped and was taken up with the support of Transcend platinum micro guide wire.  The microcatheter was then taken up into the internal carotid artery under biplane roadmapping and was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery and was pointed towards the A1.  60 mg of papaverine was then slowly infused into the internal carotid artery and the anterior cerebral artery.  Post-papaverine infusion images showed increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the left A1.  The catheter was then removed from the patient, pressure was held for 10 minutes leading to hemostasis.  Patient was then transferred back to the ICU in the Children's Hospital where he was extubated without any deficits.

INTERPRETATION OF IMAGES:

1.  LEFT COMMON/INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTIONS:  The left internal carotid artery is of normal caliber.  In the intracranial projection there is moderate spasm of the left internal carotid artery and moderately severe spasm of the left A1.  There is poor filling of the A2 through left internal carotid artery injection.  There is opacification of the ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally.  Capillary filling and venous drainage in MCA distribution is normal and it is very slow in the ACA distribution
2.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTION:  The right internal carotid artery is of normal caliber.  There is opacification of the right ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery.  The right ACA A1 is supplying bilateral A2 and there is no spasm of the distal anterior cerebral artery.  Right MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally.  Capillary filling and venous drainage are normal.
3.  POST-PAPAVERINE INJECTION:  The post-papaverine injection shows increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the anterior cerebral artery.  Of note the previously clipped internal carotid ICA bifurcation aneurysm is well clipped and there is no residual neck or filling of the dome of the aneurysm.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Well clipped left ICA bifurcation aneurysm.
2.  Moderately severe spasm of the internal carotid artery and left A1.  60 milligrams of papaverine infused leading to increased flow in the aforementioned vessels.

 35.8F, 99BPM, BP117/72, Mechanically ventilated at a rate of 22RPM on !00%FiO2. Unresponsive to verbal stimulation. CN: Pupils 7mm/5mm and unresponsive to light (fixed). No spontaneous eye movement or blink to threat. No papilledema or intraocular hemorrhage noted. Trace corneal reflexes bilaterally. No gag reflex. No oculocephalic reflex. MOTOR/SENSORY: No spontaneous movement. On noxious stimulation (Deep nail bed pressure) she either extended both upper extremities (RUE&gt;LUE), or withdrew the stimulated extremity (right &gt; left). Gait/Station/Coordination no tested. Reflexes: 1+ on right and 2+ on left with bilateral Babinski signs.

HCT 11/4/92: Large heterogeneous mass in the right temporal-parietal region causing significant parenchymal distortion and leftward subfalcine effect . There is low parenchymal density within the white matter. A hyperdense ring lies peripherally and may represent hemorrhage or calcification. The mass demonstrates inhomogeneous enhancement with contrast.

COURSE:
 Head of bed elevated to 30 degrees, Mannitol and DPH were continued. MRI of Brain demonstrated a large right parietal mass with necrotic appearing center and leftward shift of midline structures. She underwent surgical resection of the tumor. Pathological analysis was consistent with adenocarcinoma. GYN exam, CT Abdomen and Pelvis, Bone scan were unremarkable. CXR revealed an right upper lobe lung nodule. She did not undergo thoracic biopsy due to poor condition. She received 3000 cGy cranial XRT in ten fractions and following this was discharged to a rehabilitation center.

In March, 1993 the patient exhibited right ptosis, poor adduction and abduction OD, 4/4 strength in the upper extremities and 5-/5- strength in the lower extremities. She was ambulatory with an ataxic gait.

She was admitted on 7/12/93 for lower cervical and upper thoracic pain, paraparesis and T8 sensory level. MRI brainstem/spine on that day revealed decreased T1 signal in the C2, C3, C6 vertebral bodies, increased T2 signal in the anterior medulla, and tectum, and spinal cord (C7-T3). Following injection of Gadolinium there was diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement from C7-T7 These findings were felt consistent with metastatic disease including possible leptomeningeal spread. Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology agreed that the patients symptoms could be due to either radiation injury and/or metastasis. The patient was treated with Decadron and analgesics and discharged to a hospice center (her choice). She died a few months later.

CC:
 Weakness.

HX:
 This 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94.

He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.

On 10/25/96, he presented with a 1.5 week h/o numbness in BLE from the mid- thighs to his toes, and worsening BLE weakness. He developed decubitus ulcers on his buttocks. He also had had intermittent urinary retention for month, chronic SOB and dysphagia. He had been sitting all day long as he could not move well and had no daytime assistance. His exam findings were consistent with his complaints. He had had no episodes of diaphoresis, headache, or elevated blood pressures. An MRI of the C-T spine, 10/26/96, revealed a prominent cervicothoracic syrinx extending down to T10. There was evidence of prior cervical laminectomy of C6-T1 with expansion of the cord in the thecalsac at that region. Multiple intradural extra spinal nodular lesions (hyperintense on T2, isointense on T1, enhanced gadolinium) were seen in the cervical spine and cisterna magna.

HX:
 This 51 y/o RHM was moving furniture several days prior to presentation when he struck his head (vertex) against a door panel. He then stepped back and struck his back on a trailer hitch. There was no associated LOC but he felt &quot;dazed.&quot; He complained a HA since the accident. The following day he began experiencing episodic vertigo lasting several minutes with associated nausea and vomiting. He has been lying in bed most of the time since the accident. He also complained of transient left lower extremity weakness. The night before admission he went to his bedroom and his girlfriend heard a loud noise. She found him on the floor unable to speak or move his left side well. He was taken to a local ER. In the ER experienced a spell in which he stared to the right for approximately one minute. During this time he was unable to speak and did not seem to comprehend verbal questions. This resolved. ER staff noted decreased left sided movement and a left Babinski sign.

He was given valium 5 mg, and DPH 1.0g. A HCT was performed and he was transferred to UIHC.

COURSE:
 PT/PTT, GS, CBC, TSH, FT4 and Cholesterol screen were all within normal limits. HCT on admission was negative. MRI Brain (done locally 2/2/93) was reviewed and a left lateral medullary stroke was appreciated. The patient underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/3/93 which revealed significant narrowing of the left vertebral artery beginning at C2 and extending to and involving the basilar artery. There is severe, irregular narrowing of the horizontal portion above the posterior arch of C1. The findings were felt consistent with a left vertebral artery dissection. Neuro-opthalmology confirmed a left Horner's pupil by clinical exam and history. Cookie swallow study was unremarkable. The Patient was placed on Heparin then converted to Coumadin. The PT on discharge was 17.

She remained on Coumadin for 3 months and then was switched to ASA for 1 year. An Otolaryngologic evaluation on 10/96 noted true left vocal cord paralysis with full glottic closure. A prosthesis was made and no surgical invention was done.

CLINICAL HISTORY:
  Gravida 1, para 0 at 33 weeks 5 days by early dating.  The patient is developing gestational diabetes.

Transabdominal ultrasound examination demonstrated a single fetus and uterus in vertex presentation.  The placenta was posterior in position.  There was normal fetal breathing movement, gross body movement, and fetal tone, and the qualitative amniotic fluid volume was normal with an amniotic fluid index of 18.2 cm.

The following measurements were obtained:  Biparietal diameter 8.54 cm, head circumference 30.96 cm, abdominal circumference 29.17 cm, and femoral length 6.58 cm.  These values predict a fetal weight of 4 pounds 15 ounces plus or minus 12 ounces or at the 42nd percentile based on gestation.

CONCLUSION:
  Normal biophysical profile (BPP) with a score of 8 out of possible 8.  The fetus is size appropriate for gestation.

EXAM: 
 CT head without contrast, CT facial bones without contrast, and CT cervical spine without contrast.

REASON FOR EXAM:
  A 68-year-old status post fall with multifocal pain.

COMPARISONS: 
 None.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the thoracic inlet without contrast.  Additional high-resolution sagittal and/or coronal reconstructed images were obtained through the facial bones and cervical spine for better visualization of the osseous structures.

INTERPRETATIONS:

HEAD:

There is mild generalized atrophy.  Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation is seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  There are subtle areas of increased attenuation seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally.  Given the patient's clinical presentation, these likely represent small hemorrhagic contusions.  Other differential considerations include cortical calcifications, which are less likely.  The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation without evidence of mass, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction.  The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  The bony calvarium and skull base are unremarkable.

FACIAL BONES:

The osseous structures about the face are grossly intact without acute fracture or dislocation.  The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits.  There is diffuse mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses.  The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted about the right orbit and right facial bones without underlying fracture.

CERVICAL SPINE:

There is mild generalized osteopenia.  There are diffuse multilevel degenerative changes identified extending from C4-C7 with disk space narrowing, sclerosis, and marginal osteophyte formation.  The remaining cervical vertebral body heights are maintained without acute fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis.  The central canal is grossly patent.  The pedicles and posterior elements appear intact with multifocal facet degenerative changes.  There is no prevertebral or paravertebral soft tissue masses identified.  The atlanto-dens interval and dens are maintained.

IMPRESSION:

1.Subtle areas of increased attenuation identified within the frontal lobes bilaterally suggesting small hemorrhagic contusions.  There is no associated shift or mass effect at this time.  Less likely, this finding could be secondary to cortical calcifications.  The patient may benefit from a repeat CT scan of the head or MRI for additional evaluation if clinically indicated.
2.Atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the brain.
3.Ethmoid and right maxillary sinus congestion and diffuse soft tissue swelling over the right side of the face without underlying fracture.
4.Osteopenia and multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as described above.
5.Findings were discussed with Dr. X from the emergency department at the time of interpretation.

EXAM:
  MRI head without contrast.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Severe headaches.

INTERPRETATION:
  Imaging was performed in the axial and sagittal planes using numerous pulse sequences at 1 tesla.  Correlation is made with the head CT of 4/18/05.

On the diffusion sequence, there is no significant bright signal to indicate acute infarction.  There is a large degree of increased signal involving the periventricular white matter extending around to the subcortical regions in symmetrical fashion consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  There is mild chronic ischemic change involving the pons bilaterally, slightly greater on the right, and when correlating with the recent scan, there is an old tiny lacunar infarct of the right brachium pontis measuring roughly 4 mm in size.  There are prominent perivascular spaces of the lenticulostriate distribution compatible with the overall degree of moderate to moderately advanced atrophy.  There is an old moderate-sized infarct of the mid and lateral aspects of the right cerebellar hemisphere as seen on the recent CT scan.  This involves mostly the superior portion of the hemisphere in the superior cerebellar artery distribution.  No abnormal mass effect is identified.  There are no findings to suggest active hydrocephalus.  No abnormal extra-axial collection is identified.  There is normal flow void demonstrated in the major vascular systems.

The sagittal sequence demonstrates no Chiari malformation.  The region of the pituitary/optic chiasm grossly appears normal.  The mastoids and paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION:

1.  No definite acute findings identified involving the brain.
2.  There is prominent chronic cerebral ischemic change as described with mild chronic pontine ischemic changes.  There is an old moderate-sized infarct of the superior portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere.
3.  Moderate to moderately advanced atrophy.

REASON FOR EXAM:
  CVA.

INDICATIONS: 
 CVA.

This is technically acceptable.  There is some limitation related to body habitus.

DIMENSIONS:  
The interventricular septum 1.2, posterior wall 10.9, left ventricular end-diastolic 5.5, and end-systolic 4.5, the left atrium 3.9.

FINDINGS: 
 The left atrium was mildly dilated.  No masses or thrombi were seen.  The left ventricle showed borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with normal wall motion and wall thickening, EF of 60%.  The right atrium and right ventricle are normal in size.

Mitral valve showed mitral annular calcification in the posterior aspect of the valve.  The valve itself was structurally normal.  No vegetations seen.  No significant MR. Mitral inflow pattern was consistent with diastolic dysfunction grade 1.  The aortic valve showed minimal thickening with good exposure and coaptation.  Peak velocity is normal.  No AI.

Pulmonic and tricuspid valves were both structurally normal.

Interatrial septum was appeared to be intact in the views obtained.  A bubble study was not performed.

No pericardial effusion was seen.  Aortic arch was not assessed.

CONCLUSIONS:

1.  Borderline left ventricular hypertrophy with normal ejection fraction at 60%.
2.  Mitral annular calcification with structurally normal mitral valve.
3.  No intracavitary thrombi is seen.
4.  Interatrial septum was somewhat difficult to assess, but appeared to be intact on the views obtained.

EXAM: 
 CT of abdomen with and without contrast.  CT-guided needle placement biopsy.

HISTORY: 
 Left renal mass.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Pre and postcontrast enhanced images were acquired through the kidneys.

FINDINGS: 
 Comparison made to the prior MRI.  There is re-demonstration of multiple bilateral cystic renal lesions.  Several of these demonstrate high attenuation in the precontrast phase of the exam suggesting that they are hemorrhagic cysts.  There was however one cyst seen in the lower pole of the left kidney, which demonstrated apparent enhancement from 30 to 70 Hounsfield units post contrast administration.  This measured approximately 1.4 x 1.3 cm to the exophytic half of the lower pole.  No other enhancing renal masses were seen.  The visualized liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands were unremarkable.  There are changes of cholecystectomy.  Mild prominence of the common bile duct is likely secondary to cholecystectomy.  There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy, masses, fluid collection, or ascites.

Lung bases are clear.  No acute bony pathology was noted.

IMPRESSION: 
 Solitary apparently enhancing left renal mass in the lower pole as described.  Renal cell carcinoma cannot be excluded.

CT-GUIDED NEEDLE BIOPSY, LEFT KIDNEY MASS: 
 Following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, the patient wished to proceed with CT-guided biopsy of left renal lesion.  The patient was placed in the decubitus position.  The region overlying the left renal mass of note was marked.  Area was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was achieved with approximately 8 mL of 1% lidocaine with bicarbonate.  The Versed and fentanyl were given to achieve conscious sedation.  Utilizing an 18 x 15 gauge coaxial system, 3 core biopsies were obtained through the mass in question, and sent to pathology for analysis.  Following procedure, scans through the region demonstrate a small subcutaneous hematoma in the region of the superficial anesthesia.  No perinephric fluid/hematoma was identified.  The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: 
 Three core biopsies through the region of the left renal tumor as described.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Followup for fetal growth. 
INTERPRETATION: 
 Real-time exam demonstrates a single intrauterine fetus in cephalic presentation with a regular cardiac rate of 147 beats per minute documented. 

FETAL BIOMETRY:  

BPD = 8.3 cm = 33 weeks, 4 days
HC = 30.2 cm = 33 weeks, 4 days
AC = 27.9 cm = 32 weeks, 0 days
FL =  6.4 cm = 33 weeks, 1 day

The head to abdomen circumference ratio is normal at 1.08, and the femur length to abdomen circumference ratio is normal at 23.0%.  Estimated fetal weight is 2,001 grams.  

The amniotic fluid volume appears normal, and the calculated index is normal for the age at 13.7 cm.  

A detailed fetal anatomic exam was not performed at this setting, this being a limited exam for growth.  The placenta is posterofundal and grade 2.
IMPRESSION: 
 Single viable intrauterine pregnancy in cephalic presentation with a composite gestational age of 32 weeks, 5 days, plus or minus 17 days, giving and estimated date of confinement of 8/04/05.  There has been normal progression of fetal growth compared to the two prior exams of 2/11/05 and 4/04/05.  The examination of 4/04/05 questioned an echogenic focus within the left ventricle.  The current examination does not demonstrate any significant persistent echogenic focus involving the left ventricle. 

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:

1.  Selective ascending aortic arch angiogram.
2.  Selective left common carotid artery angiogram.
3.  Selective right common carotid artery angiogram.
4.  Selective left subclavian artery angiogram.
5.  Right iliac angio with runoff.
6.  Bilateral cerebral angiograms were performed as well via right and left common carotid artery injections.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: 
 TIA, aortic stenosis, postoperative procedure.  Moderate carotid artery stenosis.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
  400 ml.

SPECIMENS REMOVED:
  Not applicable.

TECHNIQUE OF PROCEDURE: 
 After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the cardiac catheterization suite in postabsorptive and nonsedated state.  The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 2% was used for infiltration anesthesia.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French sheath was placed into the right common femoral artery and vein without complication.  Using injection through the side port of the sheath, a right iliac angiogram with runoff was performed.  Following this, straight pigtail catheter was used to advance the aortic arch and aortic arch angiogram under digital subtraction was performed.  Following this, selective engagement in left common carotid artery, right common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery angiograms were performed with a V-Tech catheter over an 0.035-inch wire.

ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:

1.  Type 2 aortic arch.
2.  Left subclavian artery was patent.
3 Left vertebral artery was patent.
4.  Left internal carotid artery had a 40% to 50% lesion with ulceration, not treated and there was no cerebral cross over.
5.  Right common carotid artery had a 60% to 70% lesion which was heavily calcified and was not treated with the summed left-to-right cross over flow.
6.  Closure was with a 6-French Angio-Seal of the artery, and the venous sheath was sutured in.

PLAN:
  Continue aspirin, Plavix, and Coumadin to an INR of 2 with a carotid duplex followup.

INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY SIMULATION

The patient will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy in order to deliver high-dose treatment to sensitive structures.  The target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures.

Initially, the preliminary isocenter is set on a fluoroscopically-based simulation unit.  The patient is appropriately immobilized using a customized immobilization device.  Preliminary simulation films are obtained and approved by me.  The patient is marked and transferred to the CT scanner.  Sequential images are obtained and transferred electronically to the treatment planning software.  Extensive analysis then occurs.  The target volume, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected.  In addition organs at risk are outlined.  Appropriate doses are selected, both for the target, as well as constraints for organs at risk.  Inverse treatment planning is performed by the physics staff under my supervision.  These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician and completion of successful quality assurance.

3-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION

This patient is undergoing 3-dimensionally planned radiation therapy in order to adequately target structures at risk while diminishing the degree of exposure to uninvolved adjacent normal structures.  This optimizes the chance of controlling tumor while diminishing the acute and long-term side effects.  With conformal 3-dimensional simulation, there is extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist effort and time expended.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room where appropriate markers are placed and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  Preliminary filed sizes and arrangements, including gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields are conceived.  Radiographs are taken and these films are approved by the physician.  Appropriate marks are placed on the patient's skin or on the  immobilization device.

The patient is transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are performed through the targeted area.  The scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on the CT images.  The dosimetrist then evaluates the slices in the treatment-planning computer with appropriately marked structures.  This volume is reconstructed in a virtual 3-dimensional space utilizing the beam's-eye view features.  Appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide coverage of the target volume while minimizing dose to normal structures.

Once appropriate beam parameters and isodose distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, the individual slices are then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, physical blocks or multi-leaf collimator equivalents will be devised.  If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where computer designed fields are re-simulated.

In view of the extensive effort and time expenditure required, this procedure justifies the special procedure code, 77470.

INDICATION: 
 Lung carcinoma.

Whole body PET scanning was performed with 11 mCi of 18 FDG. Axial, coronal and sagittal imaging was performed over the neck, chest abdomen and pelvis.

FINDINGS:

There is normal physiologic activity identified in the myocardium, liver, spleen, ureters, kidneys and bladder.

There is abnormal FDG-avid activity identified in the posterior left paraspinal region best seen on axial images 245-257 with an SUV of 3.8, no definite bone lesion is identified on the CT scan or the bone scan dated 08/14/2007 (It may be purely lytic).

Additionally there is a significant area of activity corresponding to a mass in the region of the left hilum that is visible on the CT scan with an SUV of 18.1, the adjacent atelectasis as likely post obstructive in nature.

Additionally, although there is no definite lesion identified on CT , there is a tiny satellite nodule in the left upper lobe that is hypermetabolic with an SUV of 5.0. The spiculated density seen in the right upper lobe on the CT scan does not demonstrate FDG activity on this PET scan.

There is a hypermetabolic lymph node identified in the aorta pulmonary window with an SUV of 3.7 in the mediastinum.

IMPRESSION:

No prior PET scans for comparison, there is a large lesion identified in the area of the left hilum with an SUV of 18.1 likely causing the obstructive atelectasis seen on the CT scan.

There is a tiny satellite area of hypermetabolic FDG in the left upper lobe adjacent to the pleura with an SUV of 5.0.

There is a area of hypermetabolic activity in the left paraspinal soft tissues at the level of the lung apices which may represent a focal bone lesion. However no lesion is identified on bone scan or CT scan.

There is a hypermetabolic lymph node identified. The aorta pulmonary window with a corresponding finding on CT scan with an SUV of 3.7.

EXAM:
MRI LEFT SHOULDER

CLINICAL:
This is a 69-year-old male with pain in the shoulder. Evaluate for rotator cuff tear.

FINDINGS:

Examination was performed on 9/1/05.

There is marked supraspinatus tendinosis and extensive tearing of the substance of the tendon and articular surface, extending into the myotendinous junction as well. There is still a small rim of tendon along the bursal surface, although there may be a small tear at the level of the rotator interval. There is no retracted tendon or muscular atrophy (series #6 images #6-17).

Normal infraspinatus tendon.

There is subscapularis tendinosis with fraying and partial tearing of the superior most fibers extending to the level of the rotator interval (series #9 images #8-13; series #3 images #8-14). There is no complete tear, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy.

There is tendinosis and superficial tearing of the long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove, and there is high grade (near complete) partial tearing of the intracapsular portion of the tendon. The biceps anchor is intact. There are degenerative changes in the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no fracture or subluxation.

There is degeneration of the superior labrum and there is a small nondisplaced tear in the posterior superior labrum at the one to two o'clock position (series #6 images #12-14; series #3 images #8-10; series #9 images #5-8). There is a small sublabral foramen at the eleven o'clock position (series #9 image #6). There is no osseous Bankart lesion.

Normal superior, middle and inferior glenohumeral ligaments.

There is hypertrophic osteoarthropathy of the acromioclavicular joint with narrowing of the subacromial space and flattening of the superior surface of the supraspinatus musculotendinous junction, which in the appropriate clinical setting is an MRI manifestation of an impinging lesion (series #8 images #3-12).

Normal coracoacromial, coracohumeral and coracoclavicular ligaments. There is minimal fluid within the glenohumeral joint. There is no atrophy of the deltoid muscle.

IMPRESSION:
  There is extensive supraspinatus tendinosis and partial tearing as described. There is no retracted tendon or muscular atrophy, but there may be a small tear along the anterior edge of the tendon at the level of the rotator interval, and this associated partial tearing of the superior most fibers of the subscapularis tendon.  There is also a high-grade partial tear of the long biceps tendon as it courses under the transverse humeral ligament. There is no evidence of a complete tear or retracted tendon. Small nondisplaced posterior superior labral tear. Outlet narrowing from the acromioclavicular joint, which in the appropriate clinical setting is an MRI manifestation of an impinging lesion.

EXAM:
  Bilateral carotid ultrasound.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Headache.

TECHNIQUE:  
Color grayscale and Doppler analysis is employed.

FINDINGS:
  On the grayscale images, the right common carotid artery demonstrates patency with mild intimal thickening only.  At the level of the carotid bifurcation, there is heterogeneous hard plaque present, but without grayscale evidence of greater than 50% stenosis.  Right common carotid waveform is normal with a peak systolic velocity of 0.474 m/second and an end-diastolic velocity of 0.131 m/second.  The right ECA is patent as well with the velocity measurement 0.910 m/second.

The right internal carotid artery at the bifurcation demonstrates plaque formation, but no evidence of greater than 50% stenosis.  Proximal peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery is 0.463 m/second with proximal end-diastolic velocity of 0.170.  The mid internal carotid peak systolic velocity is 0.564 m/second, and mid ICA end-diastolic velocity is 0.199 m/second.  Right ICA distal PSV 0.580 m/second, right ICA distal EDV 0.204 m/second.  Vertebral flow is antegrade on the right at 0.469 m/second.

On the left, the common carotid artery demonstrates intimal thickening, but is otherwise patent.  At the level of the bifurcation, however, there is more pronounced plaque formation with approximately 50% stenosis by the grayscale analysis.  See the velocity measurements below:

Left carotid ECA measurement 0.938 m/second.  Left common carotid PSV 0.686 m/second, and left common carotid end-diastolic velocity 0.137 m/second.

Left internal carotid artery again demonstrates prominent focus of hard plaque with up to at least 50% stenosis.  This should be further assessed with CTA for more precise measurement.  The left proximal ICA/PSV 0.955 m/second, left proximal ICA/EDV 0.287 m/second.  There is spectral broadening in the proximal aspect of the carotid waveform.  The left carotid ICA mid PSV 0.895, left carotid ICA mid EDV 0.278 with also spectral broadening present.

The left distal ICA/PSV 0.561, left distal ICA/EDV 0.206, again the spectral broadening present.  Vertebral flow is antegrade at 0.468 m/second.

IMPRESSION: 
 The study demonstrates bilateral hard plaque at the bifurcation, left greater than right.  There is at least 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at its bifurcation and a followup CTA is recommended for further assessment.

EXAM: 
 Barium enema.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 
 A 4-year-old male with a history of encopresis and constipation.

TECHNIQUE:  
A single frontal scout radiograph of the abdomen was performed.  A rectal tube was inserted in usual sterile fashion, and retrograde instillation of barium contrast was followed via spot fluoroscopic images.  A post-evacuation overhead radiograph of the abdomen was performed.

FINDINGS:
  The scout radiograph demonstrates a nonobstructive gastrointestinal pattern.  There are no suspicious calcifications seen or evidence of gross free intraperitoneal air.  The visualized lung bases and osseous structures are within normal limits.

The rectum and colon is of normal caliber throughout its course.  There is no evidence of obstruction, as contrast is seen to flow without difficulty into the right colon and cecum.  A small amount of contrast is seen to opacify small bowel loops on the post-evacuation image.  There is also opacification of a normal-appearing appendix documented.

IMPRESSION: 
 Normal barium enema.

REFERRING DIAGNOSIS: 
 Motor neuron disease.

PERTINENT HISTORY AND EXAMINATION:
  Briefly, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of progression of dysphagia for the past year, dysarthria, weakness of her right arm, cramps in her legs, and now with progressive weakness in her upper extremities.

SUMMARY:  
The right median sensory response showed a borderline normal amplitude for age with mild slowing of conduction velocity.  The right ulnar sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity.  The right radial sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity.  The right sural and left sural sensory responses were absent.  The right median motor response showed a prolonged distal latency across the wrist, with proximal slowing.  The distal amplitude was very reduced, and there was a reduction with proximal stimulation.  The right ulnar motor amplitude was borderline normal, with slowing of the conduction velocity across the elbow.  The right common peroneal motor response showed a decreased amplitude when recorded from the EDB, with mild slowing of the proximal conduction velocity across the knee.  The right tibial motor response showed a reduced amplitude with prolongation of the distal latency.  The left common peroneal response recorded from the EDB showed a decreased amplitude with mild distal slowing.  The left tibial motor response showed a decreased amplitude with a borderline normal distal latency.  The minimum F-wave latencies were normal with the exception of a mild prolongation of the ulnar F-wave latency, and the tibial F-wave latency as indicated above.  With repetitive nerve stimulation, there was no significant decrement noted in either the right nasalis or the right trapezius muscles.  Concentric needle EMG studies were performed in the right lower extremity, right upper extremity, thoracic paraspinals, and in the tongue.  There was evidence of increased insertional activity in the right tibialis anterior muscle, with evidence of fasciculations noted in several lower and upper extremity muscles and in the tongue.  In addition, there was evidence of increased amplitude, long duration and polyphasic motor units with a decreased recruitment noted in most muscles tested as indicated in the table above.

INTERPRETATION: 
 Abnormal electrodiagnostic study.  There is electrodiagnostic evidence of a disorder of the anterior motor neurons affecting at least four segments.  There is also evidence of a more generalized neuropathy that seems to be present in both the upper and lower extremities.  There is also evidence of a right median mononeuropathy at the wrist and a right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.  Even despite the patient's age, the decrease in sensory responses is concerning, and makes it difficult to be certain about the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.  However, the overall changes on the needle EMG would be consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease.  The patient will return for further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Sequential axial CT images were obtained through the cervical spine without contrast.  Additional high resolution coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were also obtained for better visualization of the osseous structures.  

FINDINGS: 
 The cervical spine demonstrates normal alignment and mineralization with no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis.  The vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained.  The central canal is patent.  The pedicles and posterior elements are intact.  The paravertebral soft tissues are within normal limits.  The atlanto-dens interval and the dens are intact.  The visualized lung apices are clear.

IMPRESSION: 
 No acute abnormalities.

3.  Mild hypertension at 160/84.
4.  Left bundle-branch block.


CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY FOR CURATIVE INTENT PATIENTS

This patient is receiving combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy in an effort to maximize the chance of control of this cancer.  The chemotherapy is given in addition to the radiotherapy, not only to act as a cytotoxic agent on its own, but also to potentiate and enhance the effect of radiotherapy on tumor cells.  It has been shown in the literature that this will maximize the chance of control.

During the course of the treatment, the patient's therapy must be closely monitored by the attending physician to be sure that the proper chemotherapy drugs are given at the proper time during the radiotherapy course.  It is also important to closely monitor the patient to know when treatment with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy needs to be held.  This combined treatment usually produces greater side effects than either treatment alone, and these need to be constantly monitored and treatment initiated on a timely basis to minimize these effects.  In accordance, this requires more frequency consultation and coordination with the medical oncologist.  Therefore, this becomes a very time intensive treatment and justifies CPT Code 77470.

EXAM:
  Renal ultrasound.

HISTORY: 
 Renal failure, neurogenic bladder, status-post cystectomy.

TECHNIQUE: 
 Multiple ultrasonographic images of the kidneys were obtained in the transverse and longitudinal planes.

COMPARISON:
  Most recently obtained mm/dd/yy.

FINDINGS:
  The right kidney measures 12 x 5.2 x 4.6 cm and the left kidney measures 12.2 x 6.2 x 4.4 cm.  The imaged portions of the kidneys fail to demonstrate evidence of mass, hydronephrosis or calculus.  There is no evidence of cortical thinning.

Incidentally there is a rounded low-attenuation mass within the inferior aspect of the right lobe of the liver measuring 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.9 cm which has suggestion of some peripheral blood flow.

IMPRESSION:

1.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2.  Mass within the right lobe of the liver.  The patient apparently has a severe iodine allergy.  Further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
3.  The results of this examination were given to XXX in Dr. XXX office on mm/dd/yy at XXX


CC:
 Memory difficulty.

HX: 
This 64 y/o RHM had had difficulty remembering names, phone numbers and events for 12 months prior to presentation, on 2/28/95. This had been called to his attention by the clerical staff at his parish--he was a Catholic priest. He had had no professional or social faux pas or mishaps due to his memory. He could not tell whether his problem was becoming worse, so he brought himself to the Neurology clinic on his own referral.

MEDS:
 None.

PMH: 
1)appendectomy, 2)tonsillectomy, 3)childhood pneumonia, 4)allergy to sulfa drugs.

FHX:
 Both parents experienced memory problems in their ninth decades, but not earlier. 5 siblings have had no memory trouble. There are no neurological illnesses in his family.

SHX:
 Catholic priest. Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use.

EXAM:
  BP131/74, HR78, RR12, 36.9C, Wt. 77kg, Ht. 178cm.

MS: A&O to person, place and time. 29/30 on MMSE; 2/3 recall at 5 minutes. 2/10 word recall at 10 minutes. Unable to remember the name of the President (Clinton). 23words/60 sec on Category fluency testing (normal). Mild visual constructive deficit.

The rest of the neurologic exam was unremarkable and there were no extrapyramidal signs or primitive reflexes noted.

COURSE:
 TSH 5.1, T4 7.9, RPR non-reactive. Neuropsychological evaluation, 3/6/95, revealed: 1)well preserved intellectual functioning and orientation, 2) significant deficits in verbal and visual memory, proper naming, category fluency and working memory, 3)performances which were below expectations on tests of speed of reading, visual scanning, visual construction and clock drawing, 4)limited insight into the scope and magnitude of cognitive dysfunction. The findings indicated multiple areas of cerebral dysfunction. With the exception of the patient's report of minimal occupational dysfunction ( which may reflect poor insight), the clinical picture is consistent with a progressive dementia syndrome such as Alzheimer's disease. MRI brain, 3/6/95, showed mild generalized atrophy, more severe in the occipital-parietal regions.

In 4/96, his performance on repeat neuropsychological evaluation was relatively stable. His verbal learning and delayed recognition were within normal limits, whereas delayed recall was &quot;moderately severely&quot; impaired. Immediate and delayed visual memory were slightly below expectations. Temporal orientation and expressive language skills were below expectation, especially in word retrieval. These findings were suggestive of particular, but not exclusive, involvement of the temporal lobes.

On 9/30/96, he was evaluated for a 5 minute spell of visual loss, OU. The episode occurred on Friday, 9/27/96, in the morning while sitting at his desk doing paperwork. He suddenly felt that his gaze was pulled toward a pile of letters; then a &quot;curtain&quot; came down over both visual fields, like &quot;everything was in the shade.&quot; During the episode he felt fully alert and aware of his surroundings. He concurrently heard a &quot;grating sound&quot; in his head. After the episode, he made several phone calls, during which he reportedly sounded confused, and perseverated about opening a bank account. He then drove to visit his sister in Muscatine, Iowa, without accident. He was reportedly &quot;normal&quot; when he reached her house. He was able to perform Mass over the weekend without any difficulty. Neurologic examination, 9/30/96, was notable for: 1)category fluency score of 18items/60 sec. 2)VFFTC and EOM were intact. There was no RAPD, INO, loss of visual acuity. Glucose 178 (elevated), ESR ,Lipid profile, GS, CBC with differential, Carotid duplex scan, EKG, and EEG were all normal. MRI brain, 9/30/96, was unchanged from previous, 3/6/95.

On 1/3/97, he had a 30 second spell of lightheadedness without vertigo, but with balance difficulty, after picking up a box of books. The episode was felt due to orthostatic changes.

1/8/97 neuropsychological evaluation was stable and his MMSE score was 25/30 (with deficits in visual construction, orientation, and 2/3 recall at 1 minute). Category fluency score 23 items/60 sec. Neurologic exam was notable for graphesthesia in the left hand.

In 2/97, he had episodes of anxiety, marked fluctuations in job performance and resigned his pastoral position. His neurologic exam was unchanged. An FDG-PET scan on 2/14/97 revealed decreased uptake in the right posterior temporal-parietal and lateral occipital regions.

EXAM: 
 Left heart cath, selective coronary angiogram, right common femoral angiogram, and StarClose closure of right common femoral artery.

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Abnormal stress test and episode of shortness of breath.

PROCEDURE: 
 Right common femoral artery, 6-French sheath, JL4, JR4, and pigtail catheters were used.

FINDINGS:

1.  Left main is a large-caliber vessel.  It is angiographically free of disease,
2.  LAD is a large-caliber vessel.  It gives rise to two diagonals and septal perforator.  It erupts around the apex.  LAD shows an area of 60% to 70% stenosis probably in its mid portion.  The lesion is a type A finishing before the takeoff of diagonal 1.  The rest of the vessel is angiographically free of disease.
3.  Diagonal 1 and diagonal 2 are angiographically free of disease.
4.  Left circumflex is a small-to-moderate caliber vessel, gives rise to 1 OM.  It is angiographically free of disease.
5.  OM-1 is angiographically free of disease.
6.  RCA is a large, dominant vessel, gives rise to conus, RV marginal, PDA and one PL.  RCA has a tortuous course and it has a 30% to 40% stenosis in its proximal portion.
7.  LVEDP is measured 40 mmHg.
8.  No gradient between LV and aorta is noted.

Due to contrast concern due to renal function, no LV gram was performed.

Following this, right common femoral angiogram was performed followed by StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.

IMPRESSION:

1.  60% to 70% mid left anterior descending stenosis.
2.  Mild 30% to 40% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery.
3.  Status post StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.

PLAN:  
Plan will be to perform elective PCI of the mid LAD.

LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS DOPPLER ULTRASOUND

REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Status post delivery five weeks ago presenting with left calf pain.

INTERPRETATIONS: 
 There was normal flow, compression and augmentation within the right common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins.  Lymph nodes within the left inguinal region measure up to 1 cm in short-axis.

IMPRESSION: 
 Lymph nodes within the left inguinal region measure up to 1 cm in short-axis, otherwise no evidence for left lower extremity venous thrombosis.

HISTORY: 
 Advanced maternal age and hypertension.

FINDINGS:
  There is a single live intrauterine pregnancy with a vertex lie, posterior placenta, and adequate amniotic fluid.  The amniotic fluid index is 23.2 cm.  Estimated gestational age based on prior ultrasound is 36 weeks 4 four days with an estimated date of delivery of 03/28/08.  Based on fetal measurements obtained today, estimated fetal weight is 3249 plus or minus 396 g, 7 pounds 3 ounces plus or minus 14 ounces, which places the fetus in the 66th percentile for the estimated gestational age.  Fetal heart motion at a rate of 156 beats per minute is documented.  The cord Doppler ratio is normal at 2.2.  The biophysical profile score, assessing fetal breathing movement, gross body movement, fetal tone, and qualitative amniotic fluid volume is 8/8.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Single live intrauterine pregnancy in vertex presentation with an estimated gestational age of 36 weeks 4 days and established due date of 03/28/08.
2.  Biophysical profile (BPP) score 8/8.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 Swelling of lips causing difficulty swallowing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
 This patient is a 57-year old white Cuban woman with a long history of rheumatoid arthritis.  She has received methotrexate on a weekly basis as an outpatient for many years.  Approximately two weeks ago, she developed a respiratory infection for which she received antibiotics.  She developed some ulcerations of the mouth and was instructed to discontinue the methotrexate approximately ten days ago.  She showed some initial improvement, but over the last 3-5 days has had malaise, a low-grade fever, and severe oral ulcerations with difficulty in swallowing although she can drink liquids with less difficulty.  

The patient denies any other problems at this point except for a flare of arthritis since discontinuing the methotrexate.  She has rather diffuse pain involving both large and small joints.  

MEDICATIONS:
 Prednisone 7.5 mg p.o. q.d., Premarin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d., and Dolobid 1000 mg p.o. q.d., recently discontinued because of questionable allergic reaction.  HCTZ 25 mg p.o. q.o.d., Oral calcium supplements.  In the past she has been on penicillin, azathioprine, and hydroxychloroquine, but she has not had Azulfidine, cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil.

 Patient is admitted for IV hydration and treatment of oral ulcerations.  We will obtain a dermatology consult.  IV leucovorin will be started, and the patient will be put on high-dose corticosteroids.  

REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
 Possible free air under the diaphragm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a 77-year-old female who is unable to give any information.  She has been sedated with Ativan and came into the emergency room obtunded and unable to give any history.  On a chest x-ray for what appeared to be shortness of breath she was found to have what was thought to be free air under the right diaphragm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Significant for alcohol abuse.  Unable to really gather any other information because she is so obtunded.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  
Looking at the medical chart, she had an appendectomy, right hip fracture from a fall in 2005, and TAH/BSO.

MEDICATIONS:
  Unable to evaluate.

ALLERGIES: 
 UNABLE TO EVALUATE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  
Significant history of alcohol abuse, according to the emergency room physician, who sees her on a regular basis.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 Unable to obtain.

PHYSICAL EXAM

VITAL SIGNS:  Temp 98.3, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 24, and blood pressure 141/70.
GENERAL:  She is a very obtunded female who upon arousal is not able to provide any information of any use.
HEENT:  Atraumatic.
NECK:  Soft and supple.
LUNGS:  Bilaterally diminished.
HEART:  Regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, and with deep palpation I am unable to arouse the patient, unable to elicit any tenderness.

X-ray of the chest shows the possibility of free air; therefore, a CT scan was obtained because of the patient's physical examination, which shows no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology.  The etiology of the air under the diaphragm is actually a colonic air that is anterior superior to the dome of the diaphragm, near the dome of the liver.

ASSESSMENT: 
 No intra-abdominal pathology.

PLAN:
  Have her admitted to the medical service for treatment of her hyponatremia.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 &quot;A lot has been thrown at me.&quot;

The patient is interviewed with husband in room.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 This is a 69-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of Huntington disease, who presented to Hospital four days ago after an overdose of about 30 Haldol tablets 5 mg each and Tylenol tablet 325 mg each, 40 tablets.  She has been on the medical floor for monitoring and is medically stable and was transferred to the psychiatric floor today.  The patient states she had been thinking about suicide for a couple of weeks.  Felt that her Huntington disease had worsened and she wanted to spare her family and husband from trouble.  Reports she has been not socializing with her family because of her worsening depression.  Husband notes that on Monday after speaking to Dr. X, they had been advised to alternate the patient's Pamelor (nortriptyline) to every other day because the patient was reporting dry mouth.  They did as they have instructed and husband feels this may have had some factor on her worsening depression.  The patient decided to ingest the pills when her husband went to work on Friday.  She thought Friday would be a good day because there would be less medical people working so her chances of receiving medical care would be lessened.  Her husband left around 7 in the morning and returned around 11 and found her sleeping.  About 30 minutes after his arrival, he found the empty bottles and woke up the patient to bring her to the hospital.

She says she wishes she would have died, but is happy she is alive and is currently not suicidal because she notes her sons may be have to be tested for the Huntington gene.  She does not clearly explain how this has made her suicidality subside.

This is the third suicide attempt in the last two months for this patient.  About two months ago, the patient took an overdose of Tylenol and some other medication, which the husband and the patient are not able to recall.  She was taken to Southwest Memorial Hermann Hospital.  A few weeks ago, the patient tried to shoot herself and the gun was fired and there is a blow-hole in the floor.  Husband locked the gun after that and she was taken to Bellaire Hospital.  The patient has had three psychiatric admissions in the past two months, two to Southwest Memorial and one to Bellaire Hospital for 10 days.  She sees Dr. X once or twice weekly.  He started seeing her after her first suicide attempt.

The patient's husband and the patient state that until March 2009, the patient was independent, was driving herself around and was socially active.  Since then she has had worsening of her Huntington symptoms including short-term memory loss.  At present, the patient could not operate the microwave or operate her cell phone and her husband says that she is progressively more withdrawn, complains about anxiety, and complains about shortness of breath.  The patient notes that she has had depressive symptoms of quitting social life, the patient being withdrawn for the past few months and excessive worry about her Huntington disease.

The patient's mother passed away 25 years ago from Huntington's.  Her grandmother passed away 50 years ago and two brothers also passed away of Huntington's.  The patient has told her husband that she does not want to go that way.  The patient denies auditory or visual hallucinations, denies paranoid ideation.  The husband and the patient deny any history of manic or hypomanic symptoms in the past.

PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: 
 As per the HPI, this is her third suicide attempt in the last two months and started seeing Dr. X.  She has a remote history of being on Lexapro for depression.

MEDICATIONS: 
 Her medications on admission, alprazolam 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Artane 2 mg p.o. b.i.d., Haldol 2.5 mg p.o. t.i.d., Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily, nortriptyline 50 mg p.o. daily.  Husband has stated that the patient's chorea becomes better when she takes Haldol.  Alprazolam helps her with anxiety symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Huntington disease, symptoms of dementia and hypertension.  She has an upcoming appointment with the Neurologist.  Currently, does have a primary care physician and _______ having an outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. X, and her current Neurologist, Dr. Y.

ALLERGIES: 
 CODEINE AND KEFLEX.

FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  
Strong family history for Huntington disease as per the HPI.  Mother and grandmother died of Huntington disease.  Two young brothers also had Huntington disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  The patient is a 74-year-old white woman who has a past medical history of hypertension for 15 years, history of CVA with no residual hemiparesis and uterine cancer with pulmonary metastases, who presented for evaluation of recent worsening of the hypertension.  According to the patient, she had stable blood pressure for the past 12-15 years on 10 mg of lisinopril.  In August of 2007, she was treated with doxorubicin and, as well as Procrit and her blood pressure started to go up to over 200s.  Her lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily.  She was also given metoprolol and HCTZ two weeks ago, after she visited the emergency room with increased systolic blood pressure.  Denies any physical complaints at the present time.  Denies having any renal problems in the past.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  As above plus history of anemia treated with Procrit.  No smoking or alcohol use and lives alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:
  Unremarkable.

PRESENT MEDICATIONS: 
 As above.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 Cardiovascular:  No chest pain.  No palpitations.  Pulmonary:  No shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing.  Gastrointestinal:  No nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  GU:  No nocturia.  Denies having gross hematuria.  Salt intake is minimal.  Neurological:  Unremarkable, except for history of old CVA.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 Blood pressure today is 182/78.  Examination of the head is unremarkable.  Neck is supple with no JVD.  Lungs are clear.  There is no abdominal bruit.  Extremities 1+ edema bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:
  Urinalysis done in the office shows 1+ proteinuria; same is shown by urinalysis done at Hospital.  The creatinine is 0.8.  Renal ultrasound showed possible renal artery stenosis and a 2 cm cyst in the left kidney.  MRA of the renal arteries was essentially unremarkable with no suspicion for renal artery stenosis.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
  Accelerated hypertension.  No clear-cut etiology for recent worsening since renal artery stenosis was ruled out by negative MRA.  I could only blame Procrit initiation, as well as possible fluid retention as a cause of the patient's accelerated hypertension.  She was started on hydrochlorothiazide less than two weeks ago with some improvement in her hypertension.  At this point, I would not pursue a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.  Since she is maxed out on lisinopril and her pulse is 60, I would not increase beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor.  I will continue HCTZ at 24 mg daily.  The patient was also given a sample of Tekturna, which would hopefully improve her systolic blood pressure.  The patient was told to be stick with her salt intake.  She will report to me in 10 days with the result of her blood pressure.  She will also repeat an SMA7 to rule out possible hyperkalemia due to Tekturna.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
  Fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  This is an 18-month-old white male here with his mother for complaint of intermittent fever for the past five days.  Mother states he just completed Amoxil several days ago for a sinus infection.  Patient does have a past history compatible with allergic rhinitis and he has been taking Zyrtec serum.  Mother states that his temperature usually elevates at night.  Two days his temperature was 102.6.  Mother has not taken it since, and in fact she states today he seems much better.  He is cutting an eye tooth that causes him to be drooling and sometimes fussy.  He has had no vomiting or diarrhea.  There has been no coughing.  Nose secretions are usually discolored in the morning, but clear throughout the rest of the day.  Appetite is fine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

General:  He is alert in no distress.
Vital Signs:  Afebrile.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and react to light.  TMs are clear bilaterally.  Nares patent.  Clear secretions present.  Oropharynx is clear.
Neck:  Supple.

3.  Sinusitis resolved.
4.  Teething.

PLAN:
  Mother has been advised to continue Zyrtec as directed daily.  Supportive care as needed.  Reassurance given and he is to return to the office as scheduled.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
  Breast reconstruction post mastectomy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a 51-year-old lady, who had gone many years without a mammogram when she discovered a lump in her right breast early in February of this year.  She brought this to the attention of her primary care doctor and she soon underwent ultrasound and mammogram followed by needle biopsy, which revealed that there was breast cancer.  This apparently was positive in two separate locations within the suspicious area.  She also underwent MRI, which suggested that there was significant size to the area involved.  Her contralateral left breast appeared to be uninvolved.  She has had consultation with Dr. ABC and they are currently in place to perform a right mastectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Positive for hypertension, which is controlled on medications.  She is a nonsmoker and engages in alcohol only moderately.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 
 Surgical history includes uterine fibroids, some kind of cyst excision on her foot, and cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES: 
 None known.

MEDICATIONS: 
 Lipitor, ramipril, Lasix, and potassium.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 On examination, the patient is a healthy looking 51-year-old lady, who is moderately overweight.  Breast exam reveals significant breast hypertrophy bilaterally with a double D breast size and significant shoulder grooving from her bra straps.  There are no any significant scars on the right breast as she has only undergone needle biopsy at this point.  Exam also reveals abdomen where there is moderate excessive fat, but what I consider a good morphology for a potential TRAM flap.

IMPRESSION:
  A 51-year-old lady for mastectomy on the right side, who is interested in the possibility of breast reconstruction.  We discussed the breast reconstruction options in some detail including immediate versus delayed reconstruction and autologous tissue versus implant reconstruction.  I think for a lady of this physical size and breast morphology that the likelihood of getting a good result with a tissue expander reconstruction is rather slim.  A further complicating factor is the fact that she may well be undergoing radiation after her mastectomy.  I would think this would make a simple tissue expander reconstruction virtually beyond the balance of consideration.  I have occasionally gotten away with tissue expanders with reasonable results in irradiated patients when they are thinner and smaller breasted, but in a heavier lady with large breasts, I think it virtually deemed to failure.  We therefore, mostly confine our discussion to the relative merits of TRAM flap breast reconstruction and latissimus dorsi reconstruction with implant.  In either case, the contralateral breast reduction would be part of the overall plan.

The patient understands that the TRAM flap although not much more lengthy of a procedure is a little comfortable recovery.  Since we are sacrificing a rectus abdominus muscle that can be more discomfort and difficulties in healing both due to it being a respiratory muscle and to its importance in sitting up and getting out of bed.  In any case, she does prefer this option in order to avoid the need for an implant.  We discussed pros and cons of the surgery, including the risks such as infection, bleeding, scarring, hernia, or bulging of the donor site, seroma of the abdomen, and fat necrosis or even the skin slough in the abdomen.  We also discussed some of the potential flap complications including partial or complete necrosis of the TRAM flap itself.

PLAN: 
 The patient is definitely interested in undergoing TRAM flap reconstruction.  At the moment, we are planning to do it as an immediate reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy.  For this reason, I have made arrangements to do initial vascular delay procedure within the next couple of days.  We may cancel this if the chance of postoperative irradiation is high.  If this is the case, I think we can do a better job on the reconstruction if we defer it.  The patient understands this and will proceed according to the recommendations from Dr. ABC and from the oncologist.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
 Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
The patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the Pediatric Endocrinology Department by Dr. X for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy.  The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there.  The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  She has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  There have been no skin changes.  Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  Essentially unremarkable.  The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses.  She has had no prior surgical procedures.

IMMUNIZATIONS: 
 Current and up to date.

ALLERGIES: 
 She has no known drug allergies.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  
Currently taking no routine medications.  She describes her pain level currently as zero.

FAMILY HISTORY: 
 There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter.  This was done in Tijuana.  His mom is from central portion of Mexico.  There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  
The patient is a junior at Hoover High School.  She lives with her mom in Fresno.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL:  The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.
HEENT:  The head and neck examination is most significant.  There is mild amount of facial acne.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.
NECK:  There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine.  There are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  No supraclavicular nodes were noted.
CHEST:  Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.
LUNGS:  Clear.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal.  There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.
GENITOURINARY:  External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  This is same as too for her rectal examination.
SKIN:  There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.
NEUROLOGIC:  Normal and no focal deficits.  Her voice is strong and clear.  There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.

DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 
 I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal.  Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative.  There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed.  There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.

IMPRESSION/PLAN: 
 The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  All of the family's questions have been answered.  This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 This 40-year-old white single man was hospitalized at XYZ Hospital in the mental health ward, issues were filled up by his sister and his mother.  The issues involved include the fact that for the last 10 years he has been on disability for psychiatric reasons and has been not working, and in the last several weeks to month he began to call his family talking about the fact that he had been sexually abused by brother.  He has been in outpatient therapy with Jeffrey Silverberg for the past 10 years and Mr. Silverberg became concerned about his behavior, called the family and told them to have him put in the hospital, and at one point called the police because the patient was throwing cellphones and having tantrums in his office.

The history includes the fact that the patient is the 3rd of 4 children.  A brother who is approximately 8 years older, sexually abused brother who is 4 years older.  The brother who is 8 years older lives in California and will contact the family, has had minimal contact for many years.

That brother in California is gay.  The brother who is 4 years older, sexually abused, the patient from age 8 to 12 on a regular basis.  He said, he told his mother several years ago, but she did nothing about it.

The patient finished high school and with some struggle completed college at the University of Houston.  He has a sister who is approximately a year and half younger than he is, who was sexually abused by the brothers will, but only on one occasion.  She has been concerned about patient's behavior and was instrumental in having him committed.

Reportedly, the patient ran away from home at the age of 12 or 13 because of the abuse, but was not able to tell his family what happened.

He had no or minimal psychiatric treatment growing up and after completing college worked in retail part time.

He states he injured his back about 10 yeas ago.  He told he had disk problems but never had surgery.  He subsequently was put on psychiatric disability for depression, states he has been unable to get out of bed at times and isolates and keeps to himself.

He has been on a variety of different medications including Celexa 40 mg and ADD medication different times, and reportedly has used amphetamines in the past, although he denies it at this time.  He minimizes any alcohol use which appears not to be a problem, but what does appear to be a problem is he isolates, stays at home, has been in situations where he brings in people he does not know well and he runs the risk of getting himself physically harmed.

He has never been psychiatrically hospitalized before.

MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:
  Revealed a somewhat disheveled 40-year-old man who was clearly quite depressed and somewhat shocked at his family's commitment.  He says he has not seen them on a regular basis because every time he sees them he feels hurt and acknowledged that he called up the brother who abused him and told the brother's wife what had happened.  The brother has a child and wife became very upset with him.

Normocephalic.  Pleasant, cooperative, disheveled man with about 37 to 40, thoughts were somewhat guarded.  His affect was anxious and depressed and he denied being suicidal, although the family said that he has talked about it at times.

Recent past memory were intact.

DIAGNOSES:

Axis I:  Major depression rule out substance abuse.
Axis II:  Deferred at this time.
Axis III:  Noncontributory.
Axis IV:  Family financial and social pressures.
Axis V:  Global Assessment of Functioning 40.

RECOMMENDATION:
  The patient will be hospitalized to assess.

Along the issues, the fact that he is been living in disability in the fact that his family has had to support him for all this time despite the fact that he has had a college degree.  He says he has had several part time jobs, but never been able to sustain employment, although he would like to.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
This is the initial clinic visit for a 29-year-old man who is seen for new onset of right shoulder pain.  He states that this began approximately one week ago when he was lifting stacks of cardboard.  The motion that he describes is essentially picking up a stack of cardboard at his waist level, twisting to the right and delivering it at approximately waist level.  Sometimes he has to throw the stacks a little bit as well.  He states he felt a popping sensation on 06/30/04.  Since that time, he has had persistent shoulder pain with lifting activities.  He localizes the pain to the posterior and to a lesser extent the lateral aspect of the shoulder.  He has no upper extremity .  
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
Focal lateral and posterior shoulder pain without a suggestion of any cervical radiculopathies.  He denies any chronic cardiac, pulmonary, GI, GU, neurologic, musculoskeletal, endocrine abnormalities.  
MEDICATIONS: 
 Claritin for allergic rhinitis.  
ALLERGIES:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient presents today as a consultation from Dr. ABC's office regarding the above.  He has history of neurogenic bladder, and on intermittent self-catheterization 3 times a day.  However, June 24, 2008, he was seen in the ER, and with fever, weakness, possible urosepsis.  He had a blood culture, which was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as urine culture noted for same bacteria.  He was treated on IV antibiotics, Dr. XYZ also saw the patient.  Discharged home.  Not taking any antibiotics.  Today in the office, the patient denies any dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, chills.  He is catheterizing 3 times a day, changing his catheter weekly.  Does have history of renal transplant, which has been followed by Dr. X and is on chronic steroids.  Renal ultrasound, June 23, 2008, was noted for mild hydronephrosis of renal transplant with fluid in the pericapsular space.  Creatinine, July 7, 2008 was 2.0, BUN 36, and patient tells me this is being followed by Dr. X.  No interval complaints today, no issues with catheterization or any gross hematuria.

IMPRESSION:  

1.  Neurogenic bladder, in a patient catheterizing himself 3 times a day, changing his catheter 3 times a week, we again reviewed the technique of catheterization, and he has no issues with this.
2.  Recurrent urinary tract infection, in a patient who has been hospitalized twice within the last few months, he is on steroids for renal transplant, which has most likely been overall reducing his immune system.  He is asymptomatic today.  No complaints today.

PLAN:
  Following a detailed discussion with the patient, we elected to proceed with intermittent self-catheterization, changing catheter weekly, and technique has been discussed as above.  Based on the recent culture, we will place him on Keflex nighttime prophylaxis, for the next three months or so.  He will call if any concerns.  Follow up as previously scheduled in September for re-assessment.  All questions answered.  The patient is seen and evaluated by myself.

She has also had decreased level of consciousness since yesterday.  She has had aphasia which is baseline but her aphasia has gotten significantly worse.  She eventually became unresponsive and paramedics were called.  Her blood sugar was found to be 40 because of poor p.o. intake.  She was given some D50 but that did not improve her mental status, and she was brought to the emergency department.  By the time she came to the emergency department, she started having some garbled speech.  She was able to express her husband's name and also recognize some family members, but she continued to be more somnolent when she was in the emergency department.  When seen on the floor, she is more awake, alert.

It was initially cloudy but on the floor it has cleared up.  Cultures from the one done today are pending.  The last culture done on August 20 showed guaiac negative status and prior to that she has had mixed cultures.  There is a question of her being allergic to Septra that was used for her last UTI.

IMPRESSION/PLAN:

1.  Cerebrovascular accident as evidenced by change in mental status and speech.  She seems to have recovered at this point.  We will continue Coumadin.  The patient's family is reluctant in discontinuing Coumadin but they do express the patient since has overall poor quality of life and had progressively declined over the last 6 years, the family has expressed the need for her to be on hospice and just continue comfort care at home.
2.  Recurrent urinary tract infection.  Will await culture at this time, continue Cipro.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TESTING:
  CBC was done, which had a hemoglobin of 7.7 and hematocrit of 22.6.  Neutrophils were 81%.  The RDW was 18.5, and the rest of the values were all within normal limits and unremarkable.  Chemistry had a sodium of 134, a glucose of 132, calcium is 8.2, and rest of the values are unremarkable.  Alkaline phosphatase was 770 and albumin was 2.4.  Rest of the values all are within normal limits of the LFTs.  Urinalysis was grossly bloody with a large amount of blood and greater than 50 rbc's.  The patient also had greater than 300 of the protein reading, moderate leukocytes, 30-50 white blood cells, but no bacteria were seen.  Coagulation profile study had a PT of 15.9, PTT of 43 and INR of 1.3.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: 
 The patient was given normal saline 2 liters over 1 hour without any adverse effect.  The patient was given multiple doses of morphine to maintain his comfort while here in the emergency room without any adverse effect.  The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department.  The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either.  Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free.  I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion.  It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer.  Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to.  I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion.  The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight.  The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice.  This was done.  The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match.  The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion.  There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength.  Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction.  Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder.  The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place.

DIAGNOSES

1.  HEMATURIA.
2.  PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE.
3.  SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA.

 To home with his son.

PLAN: 
 We will have the patient follow up with Dr. X in his office in 2 days for reevaluation.  The patient was given a prescription for Levaquin and Phenergan tablets to take home with him tonight.  The patient was encouraged to drink extra water.  The patient was given discharge instructions on hematuria and asked to return to the emergency room should he have any worsening of his condition or develop any other problems or symptoms of concern.
        The patient is an 84-year-old retired male who is referred to our office by Dr. O.  He comes in today with the chief complaint of low back pain which started about six to eight months ago.  He states that he does live here and also travels between here and Iowa and he does have a family in Iowa, which he is very active with his grandchildren doing shopping and plenty of walking.  He also recently cut down some trees.  He states that he started noticing some pain in his back and his hips and difficulty when beginning ambulation after getting up from a seated position due to the hip pains and the back pains.  He states he has not had any treatment for this problem.  He just does take Aleve.  He states that he began to wear a back brace, which only helps him some.  He says his pain is pretty manageable and low when he is not active, but it does increase with more activity that he does.  He is very leery about any surgical procedure, even a referral to come see us today for his brother most recently died from complications of back surgery.  He states that his back pain is intermittent.  On a 1 to 10 pain scale, he rates it a 2.  He has tried Aleve, which only helps him some.  On the body image drawing, he draws low back pain and bilateral hip pain, no radiating pain down the legs.  He describes his pain as 100% in low back and hip.  Lying down is the only alleviating factor.  Walking, light and heavy exercise exacerbate his pain.
