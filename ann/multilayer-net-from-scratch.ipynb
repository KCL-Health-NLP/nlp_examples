        "In this post I'm assuming that you are familiar with basic Calculus and Machine Learning concepts, e.g. you know what classification and regularization is. Ideally you also know a bit about how optimization techniques like gradient descent work. But even if you're not familiar with any of the above this post could still turn out to be interesting ;)\n",

        "But why implement a Neural Network from scratch at all? Even if you plan on using Neural Network libraries like [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org) in the future, implementing a network from scratch at least once is an extremely valuable exercise. It helps you gain an understanding of how neural networks work, and that is essential to designing effective models.\n",
