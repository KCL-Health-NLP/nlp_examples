    "## The NegEx algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The NegEx algorithm is a widely used algorithm in clinical NLP. It is a simple pattern matching algorithm that relies on two main lexicons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a list of terms/concepts that are the main concepts of interest for the information extraction problem, e.g. diagnoses, symptoms. These are called target terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "* a list of terms that indicate negation. In the original version of NegEx the negation terms were classified as pre-negation terms, post-negation terms, and pseudonegation terms (i.e. terms that are ambiguous). \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the algorithm works in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each sentence, look for target terms.\n",
    "* If a target term is found, check if this term is negated. This is done by looking at the surrounding words in a window of +/- 5 words within the sentence.\n",
