TITLE OF OPERATION: 
 Ligation (clip interruption) of patent ductus arteriosus.


INDICATION FOR SURGERY: 
 This premature baby with operative weight of 600 grams and evidence of persistent pulmonary over circulation and failure to thrive has been diagnosed with a large patent ductus arteriosus originating in the left-sided aortic arch.  She has now been put forward for operative intervention.


PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  

1.  Patent ductus arteriosus.
2.  Severe prematurity.
3.  Operative weight less than 4 kg (600 grams).


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


FINDINGS: 
 Large patent ductus arteriosus with evidence of pulmonary over circulation.  After completion of the procedure, left recurrent laryngeal nerve visualized and preserved.  Substantial rise in diastolic blood pressure.


DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: 
 After obtaining information consent, the patient was positioned in the neonatal intensive care unit, cribbed in the right lateral decubitus, and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced.  The left chest was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and a posterolateral thoracotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the second intercostal space was entered freely with no damage to the underlying lung parenchyma.  The lung was quite edematous and was retracted anteriorly exposing the area of the isthmus.  The pleura overlying the ductus arteriosus was inside and the duct dissected in a nearly circumferential fashion.  It was then test occluded and then interrupted with a medium titanium clip.  There was preserved pulsatile flow in the descending aorta.  The left recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and preserved.  With excellent hemostasis, the intercostal space was closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures and the muscular planes were reapproximated with 5-0 Caprosyn running suture in two layers.  The skin was closed with a running 6-0 Caprosyn suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was returned to the supine position in which palpable bilateral femoral pulses were noted.

I was the surgical attending present in the neonatal intensive care unit and in-charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Right breast mass with atypical proliferative cells on fine-needle aspiration.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Benign breast mass.


ANESTHESIA: 
 General


NAME OF OPERATION:
  Excision of right breast mass.


PROCEDURE:
  With the patient in the supine position, the right breast was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  A curvilinear incision was made directly over the mass in the upper-outer quadrant of the right breast.  Dissection was carried out around a firm mass, which was dissected with surrounding margins of breast tissue.  Hemostasis was obtained using electrocautery.  Frozen section exam showed a fibroadenoma with some proliferative hyperplasia within the fibroadenoma, but appeared benign.  The breast tissues were approximated using 4-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed using 5-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitches.  A sterile bandage was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Cervical spondylosis.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Cervical spondylosis.


OPERATION PERFORMED:
  Cervical Medial Branch Blocks under fluoroscopic control.


ANESTHESIA:
  Local and IV.


COMPLICATIONS:
  None.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
  After proper consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the fluoroscopy suite and place on a fluoroscopy table in a prone position with a chest roll in place.  The neck was placed in a flexed position.  The patient was monitored with blood pressure cuff, EKG, and pulse oximetry and given oxygen via nasal cannula.  The patient was lightly sedated.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile classical fashion.

Under fluoroscopy control, the waists of the articular pillars were identified and marked.  Local anesthesia infiltrated subcutaneously and deep extending down toward these previously marked points.  Once the anesthesia was established, a 10-cm, 22-gauge needle was placed in contact with the waists of the articular pillars at the affected levels that were previously mentioned.  This was done under direct fluoroscopic control with PA views initially for orientation utilizing a gun barrel technique and then a lateral view to determine the depth of the needle.  The needle tip was positioned such that the tip was at the posterior aspect of the articular pillar's waist and was then incrementally advanced until the tip was at the center of the pedicle, where the medial branch lies.  For C3 to C6, the medial branch is along the ventral aspect of a line that connects the greatest antero-posterior diameter of the articular pillar but remains dorsal to the foramen as seen on lateral imaging.  For a C7 medial branch block, the needle tip is positioned more superiorly such that it overlies the superior articular process.  For a C8 medial branch block, the needle is placed at the junction of the superior articulating facet and the base of the transverse process of T1.

Once the needles were in place, each level was then injected with 1cc of a 10 cc solution of Marcaine 0.5% mixed with 50mg on methyl prednisolone acetate.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any difficulties or complications.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Right upper eyelid squamous cell carcinoma.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Right upper eyelid squamous cell carcinoma.


PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
 Excision of right upper eyelid squamous cell carcinoma with frozen section and full-thickness skin grafting from the opposite eyelid.


COMPLICATIONS:  
None.


BLOOD LOSS: 
 Minimal.


ANESTHESIA:
  Local with sedation.


INDICATION:
  The patient is a 65-year-old male with a large squamous cell carcinoma on his right upper eyelid, which had previous radiation.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was taken to the operating room, laid supine, administered intravenous sedation, and prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  He was anesthetized with a combination of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine with Epinephrine on both upper eyelids.  The area of obvious scar tissue from the radiation for the squamous cell carcinoma on the right upper eyelid was completely excised down to the eyelid margin including resection of a few of the upper eye lashes.  This was extended essentially from the punctum to the lateral commissure and extended up on to the upper eyelid.  The resection was carried down through the orbicularis muscle resecting the pretarsal orbicularis muscle and the inferior portion of the preseptal orbicularis muscle leaving the tarsus intact and leaving the orbital septum intact.  Following complete resection, the patient was easily able to open and close his eyes as the levator muscle insertion was left intact to the tarsal plate.  The specimen was sent to pathology, which revealed only fibrotic tissue and no evidence of any residual squamous cell carcinoma.  Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with Bovie cautery and a full-thickness skin graft was taken from the opposite upper eyelid in a fashion similar to a blepharoplasty of the appropriate size for the defect in the right upper eyelid.  The left upper eyelid incision was closed with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures, and the skin graft was sutured in place with 6-0 fast-absorbing gut interrupted sutures.  An eye patch was placed on the right side, and the patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to PACU in good condition.

DIAGNOSIS:
  Refractory anemia that is transfusion dependent.


CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 I needed a blood transfusion.


HISTORY: 
 The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with no substantial past medical history except for diabetes.  He denies any comorbid complications of the diabetes including kidney disease, heart disease, stroke, vision loss, or neuropathy.  At this time, he has been admitted for anemia with hemoglobin of 7.1 and requiring transfusion.  He reports that he has no signs or symptom of bleeding and had a blood transfusion approximately two months ago and actually several weeks before that blood transfusion, he had a transfusion for anemia.  He has been placed on B12, oral iron, and Procrit.  At this time, we are asked to evaluate him for further causes and treatment for his anemia.  He denies any constitutional complaints except for fatigue, malaise, and some dyspnea.  He has no adenopathy that he reports.  No fevers, night sweats, bone pain, rash, arthralgias, or myalgias.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
Diabetes.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
  Hernia repair.


ALLERGIES: 
 He has no allergies.


MEDICATIONS: 
 Listed in the chart and include Coumadin, Lasix, metformin, folic acid, diltiazem, B12, Prevacid, and Feosol.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 He is a tobacco user.  He does not drink.  He lives alone, but has family and social support to look on him.


FAMILY HISTORY:
  Negative for blood or cancer disorders according to the patient.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL:  He is an elderly gentleman in no acute distress.  He is sitting up in bed eating his breakfast.  He is alert and oriented and answering questions appropriately.
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure of 110/60, pulse of 99, respiratory rate of 14, and temperature of 97.4.  He is 69 inches tall and weighs 174 pounds.
HEENT:  Sclerae show mild arcus senilis in the right.  Left is clear.  Pupils are equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx is clear.
NECK:  Supple.  Trachea is midline.  No jugular venous pressure distention is noted.  No adenopathy in the cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary areas.
CHEST:  Clear.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  There may be some fullness in the left upper quadrant, although I do not appreciate a true spleen with inspiration.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, but there is some edema, but no cyanosis.
NEUROLOGIC:  Noncontributory.
DERMATOLOGIC:  Noncontributory.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Noncontributory.


IMPRESSION: 
 At this time is refractory anemia, which is transfusion dependent.  He is on B12, iron, folic acid, and Procrit.  There are no sign or symptom of blood loss and a recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was negative.  His creatinine was 1.  My impression at this time is that he probably has an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome or bone marrow failure.  His creatinine on this hospitalization was up slightly to 1.6 and this may contribute to his anemia.


RECOMMENDATIONS:  
At this time, my recommendation for the patient is that he undergoes further serologic evaluation with reticulocyte count, serum protein, and electrophoresis, LDH, B12, folate, erythropoietin level, and he should undergo a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.  I have discussed the procedure in detail which the patient.  I have discussed the risks, benefits, and successes of that treatment and usefulness of the bone marrow and predicting his cause of refractory anemia and further therapeutic interventions, which might be beneficial to him.  He is willing to proceed with the studies I have described to him.  We will order an ultrasound of his abdomen because of the possible fullness of the spleen, and I will probably see him in follow up after this hospitalization.

As always, we greatly appreciate being able to participate in the care of your patient.  We appreciate the consultation of the patient.

HYPERFRACTIONATION


This patient is to undergo a course of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of known malignancy.  The radiotherapy will be given in a hyperfractionated fraction (decreased dose per fraction but 2 fractions delivered daily separated by a period of at least 6 hours).  The rationale for this treatment is based on radiobiologic principles that make this type of therapy more effective in rapidly growing, previously irradiated or poorly oxygenated tumors.  The dose per fraction and the total dose are calculated by me, and this is individualized for each patient according to radiobiologic principles.

During the hyperfractionated radiotherapy, the chance of severe acute side effects is increased, so the patient will be followed more intensively for the development of any side effects and treatment instituted accordingly.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSES

1.  Vomiting, probably secondary to gastroenteritis.
2.  Goldenhar syndrome.
3.  Severe gastroesophageal reflux.
4.  Past history of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES

1.  Gastroenteritis versus bowel obstruction.
2.  Gastroesophageal reflux.
3.  Goldenhar syndrome.
4.  Anemia, probably iron deficiency.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  This is a 10-week-old female infant who has Goldenhar syndrome and has a gastrostomy tube in place and a J-tube in place.  She was noted to have vomiting approximately 18 to 24 hours prior to admission and was seen in the emergency department and then admitted.

Because of her Goldenhar syndrome and previous problems with aspiration, she is not fed my mouth, but does have a G-tube.  However, she has not been tolerating feedings through this prior to admission.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL:  At transfer to UNM on October 13, 2003 reveals a dysmorphic infant who is small and slightly cachectic.  Her left side of the face is deformed with microglia present, micrognathia present, and a moderate amount of torticollis.
VITAL SIGNS:  Presently, her temperature is 98, pulse 152, respirations 36, weight is 3.98 kg, pulse oximetry on room air is 95%.
HEENT:  Head is with anterior fontanelle open.  Eyes:  Red reflex elicited bilaterally.  Left ear is without an external ear canal and the right is not well visualized at this time.  Nose is presently without any discharge, and throat is nonerythematous.  NECK:  Neck with torticollis exhibited.
LUNGS:  Presently are clear to auscultation.
HEART:  Regular rate without murmur, click or gallop present.  ABDOMEN:  Moderately distended, but soft.  Bowel sounds are decreased, and there is a G-tube and a J-tube in place.  The skin surrounding the G-tube is moderately erythematous, but without any discharges present.  J-tube is with a dressing in place and well evaluated.
EXTREMITIES:  Grossly normal.  Hip defects are not checked at this time.
GENITALIA:  Normal female.
NEUROLOGIC:  The infant does have a suck reflex, feeding grasp-reflex, and a feeding Moro reflex.
SKIN:  Warm and dry and there is a macular area to the left ___ that is approximately 1 cm in length.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 WBC count on October 12, 2003 is 12,600 with 16 segs, 6 bands, 54 lymphocytes, 13% of which are noted to be reactive.  Hemoglobin is 10.4, hematocrit 30.8, and she has abnormal red blood cell morphology.  RDW is 13.1 and MCV is 91.  Sodium level is 138, potassium 5.4, chloride 103, CO2 23, BUN 7, creatinine 0.4, glucose 84, calcium 9.9, and at this dictation, the report on the abdominal flat plate is pending.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  
The child was placed at bowel rest initially and then re-tried on full strength formula, but she did not tolerate.  She was again placed on bowel rest and her medications, Pepcid and Reglan, were given in an attempt to increase bowel motility.  Feedings were re-attempted with Pedialyte through the J-tube and these did not result in production of any stool and the child then began having vomiting again.  The vomitus was noted to be bilious in nature and with particulate matter present.

After consultation with Dr. X, it was determined the child probably needed further evaluation, and she had both of her drains placed to gravity and was kept n.p.o.  Her fluids have been D5 and 0.25 normal saline with 20 mEq/L of potassium chloride, which has run at her maintenance of 16 mL/h.


CONSULTATIONS: 
 With Dr. X and Dr. Y and the child is now ready for transport for continued diagnosis and treatment.  Her condition at discharge is stable.

FLEXIBLE BRONCHOSCOPY


The flexible bronchoscopy is performed under conscious sedation in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.  I explained to the parents that the possible risks include:  irritation of the nasal mucosa, which can be associated with some bleeding; risk of contamination of the lower airways by passage of the scope in the nasopharynx; respiratory depression from sedation; and a very small risk of pneumothorax.  A bronchoalveolar lavage may be obtained by injecting normal saline in one of the bronchi and suctioning the fluid back.  The sample will then be sent for testing.  The flexible bronchoscopy is mainly diagnostic, any therapeutic intervention, if deemed necessary, will be planned and will require a separate procedure.

The parents seem to understand, had the opportunity to ask questions and were satisfied with the information.  A booklet containing the description of the procedure and other information was provided.

PRESENTATION: 
 Patient, 13 years old, comes to your office with his mother complaining about severe ear pain.  He awoke during the night with severe ear pain, and mom states that this is the third time this year he has had earaches.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
Patient reports that he felt good after taking antibiotics with each earache episode and has recently started on the wrestling team.  Mom reports that patient has been afebrile with each of the earache episodes, and he has not had upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient denies any head trauma associated with wrestling practice.


BIRTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:
  Patient's mother reports a normal pregnancy with no complications, having received prenatal care from 12 weeks.  Vaginal delivery was uneventful with a normal perinatal course.  Patient sat alone at 6 months, crawled at 9 months, and walked at 13 months.  His verbal and motor developmental milestones were as expected.


FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 Patient lives with both parents and two siblings (brother - age 11 years, sister - age 15 years).  He reports enjoying school, remains active in scouts, and is very excited about being on the wresting team.  Mom reports that he has several friends, but she is concerned about the time required for the wrestling team.  Patient is in 8th grade this year and an A/B student.  Both siblings are healthy.  His Dad has hypertension and has frequent heartburn symptoms that he treats with over-the-counter (OTC) medications.  Mom is healthy and has asthma.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
Patient has been seen in the clinic yearly for well child exams.  He has had no major illnesses or hospitalizations.  He had one emergency room visit 2 years ago for a knee laceration.  Patient has been healthy except for the past year when he had two episodes of otitis media not associated with respiratory infections.  He received antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin) for the otitis media and both episodes resolved without problems.  Patient's Mom states that he takes no prescribed medications or OTC medications, but he admits that he has been taking his dad's OTC Pepcid AE sometimes when he gets heartburn.  Upon further examination, he reports taking Pepcid when he eats pizza or Mexican food.  He does complain of sore throats sometimes and often feels burning in his throat when he goes to sleep at night after a late evening snack.


NUTRITIONAL HISTORY: 
 Patient eats cereal bars or pop tarts with milk for breakfast most days.  He takes his lunch (usually a sandwich and chips or yogurt and fruit) for lunch.  Mom or his sister cooks supper in the evening.  The family goes out to eat once or twice a week and he only gets &quot;fast food&quot; once or twice a week according to his Mom.  He says he eats &quot;a lot&quot; especially after a wrestling meet.


PHYSICAL EXAM:

Height/weight:  Patient weighs 109 pounds (60th percentile) and is 69 inches tall (93rd percentile).  He is following the growth pattern he established in infancy.
Vital signs:  BP 110/60, T 99.2, HR 70, R 16.
General:  Alert, cooperative but a bit shy.
Neuro:  DTRs symmetric, 2+, negative Romberg, able to perform simple calculations without difficulty, short-term memory intact.  He responds appropriately to verbal and visual cues, and movements are smooth and coordinated.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, PEERLA, red reflex present, optic disk and ocular vessels normal.  TMs deep red, dull, landmarks obscured, full bilaterally.  Post auricular and submandibular nodes on left are palpable and slightly tender.
Lungs:  CTA, breath sounds equal bilaterally, excursion and chest configuration normal.
Cardiac:  S1, S2 split, no murmurs, pulses equal bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Soft, rounded, reports no epigastric tenderness but states that heartburn begins in epigastric area and rises to throat.  Bowel sounds active in all quadrants.  No hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.  No CVA tenderness.
Musculoskeletal:  Full range of motion, all extremities.  Spine straight, able to perform jumping jacks and duck walk without difficulty.
Genital:  Normal male, Tanner stage 4.  Rectal exam - small amount of soft stool, no fissures or masses.


LABS:  
Stool negative for blood and H. pylori antigen.  Normal CBC and urinalysis.  A barium swallow and upper GI was scheduled for the following week.  It showed marked GE reflux.


ASSESSMENT: 
 The differential diagnoses for patient included (a) chronic otitis media/treatment failure, (b) peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, (c) gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) or carbonated beverage syndrome, (d) trauma.


CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA. 
 Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.


PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.
  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility, particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.


GERD.
  The history of &quot;heartburn&quot; relieved by his father's medication was striking.  The positive study supported the diagnosis of GERD, which was severe and chronic enough to cause irritation of the mucosal surfaces exposed to the gastric juices and edema, inflammation in the inner ears.


PLAN:
  Patient and his Mom agreed to a trial of omeprazole 20 mg at bedtime for 2 weeks.  Patient was to keep a diary of any episodes of heartburn, including what foods seemed to aggravate it.  The clinician asked him to avoid using any antacid products in the meantime to gage the effectiveness of the medication.  He was also given a prescription for 10 days of Augmentin99 and a follow-up appointment for 2 weeks.  At his follow-up appointment he reported one episode after he ate a whole large pizza after wrestling practice but said it went away pretty quickly after he took his medication.  A 6-month follow up appointment was scheduled.

PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Local anesthesia was used to make a skin wheal 8-10 cm lateral to the L4 spinous process bilaterally from the midline.  Starting from the left side, a 20-gauge 6-inch needle was placed to the left L5-S1 facet level under AP fluoroscopic view.  On lateral view, the tip of the needle was at the inferior one-third of the LS vertebral body, anterior aspect.  Next 5 cc of Omnipaque dye was injection showing a linear spread along the anterior portion of L5 down the sacral promontory.  After negative aspiration 18 cc of 0.25% Marcaine plus 40 mg of Depo-Medrol was injection.  There were no complications.  The above sequence was repeated for the right side.  There were no complications.  The patient was discharged back to outpatient recovery in stable condition.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who was recently diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the base of the tongue bilaterally and down extension into the right tonsillar fossa.  He was also noted to have palpable level 2 cervical lymph nodes.  His staging is T3 N2c M0 Stage IV invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.  The patient comes in to the clinic today after radiation Oncology consultation.  His Otolaryngologist performed a direct laryngoscopy with biopsy on July 29, 2010.  The patient reports that in December-January timeframe, he had noted some difficulty swallowing and ear pain.  He had a work up by his local physician that was relatively negative, and he was treated for gastroesophageal reflux disease.  His symptoms continued to progress, and he developed difficulty with his speech, dysphagia, otalgia and odynophagia.  He was then referred to Dr. X and examination revealed a mass at the right base of the tongue that extended across the midline to include the left base of the tongue as well as posterior extension involved in the right tonsillar fossa.  He was noted to have bilateral neck nodes.  His biopsy was positive for squamous cell carcinoma.

LABORATORY STUDIES:

1.  A PET/CT scan shows a large hypermetabolic mass involved in the posterior aspect of the tongue, which is predominantly right-sided but extends across the midline to involve the right posterior aspect of the tongue as well.
2.  Extensive bulky hypermetabolic cervical lymphadenopathy bilaterally.
3.  No evidence of distant hypermetabolic metastatic disease.
4.  His biopsy of the right base of the tongue, invasive squamous cell carcinoma.  Biopsy of the left base of the tongue, invasive squamous cell carcinoma moderately differentiated.


ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 
 This is a pleasant but unfortunate 61-year-old gentleman who was diagnosed with stage IV, a squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx.  He has met with radiation oncology to discuss the plan and he has also been in close contact with his dentist.  He has a known abscess and is in need of some bridge work.  I discussed issues with his dentist and the patient will be seeing this Friday for cleaning.  One of the things that we will need to coordinate is evaluation of the involvement of his salivary glands.  There needs to be a discussion as to whether or not he would be better off with the tooth extraction prior to radiation.  We will coordinate this between myself, radiation oncology, and his dentist.

As far as his chemotherapy treatment, the plan at this point is to proceed with two cycles of induction chemotherapy.  The first cycle will include docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil plus Erbitux.  Typical administration is docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil on day 1 with continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil through day 4.  Erbitux will be administered on day 1 and day 8 of the first cycle.  We will plan to proceed with the second cycle to include docetaxel, cisplatin and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil without the Erbitux.  Following induction chemotherapy, we plan to obtain a PET/CT scan.  Again, this will be closely coordinated with radiation onset if they can do with planning CT at that time of the PET.  Radiation will be planned with concurrent Erbitux.  This will be given, the first dose will be one week prior to starting the radiation and then given weekly throughout radiation.  I did discuss briefly with the patient the possibility of admission for the induction chemotherapy.  The patient was not very excited at this particular discussion.  Otherwise, I do feel with him living in the Longmont area that this may be our best bet and would also be a way of being able to closely monitor his kidney function and administer the necessary hydration.  He is scheduled for chemo education on August 16.  He received prescription refill for Lortab for pain management, and I will see him in clinic when he comes in for chemotherapy education so that we can talk further about treatment administration.  I appreciate the consultation.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Cervical lymphadenopathy.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Cervical lymphadenopathy.


PROCEDURE: 
 Excisional biopsy of right cervical lymph node.


ANESTHESIA: 
 General endotracheal anesthesia.


SPECIMEN: 
 Right cervical lymph node.


EBL: 
 10 cc.


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


FINDINGS:
  Enlarged level 2 lymph node was identified and removed and sent for pathologic examination.


FLUIDS: 
 Please see anesthesia report.


URINE OUTPUT: 
 None recorded during the case.


INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: 
 This is a 43-year-old female with a several-year history of persistent cervical lymphadenopathy.  She reports that it is painful to palpation on the right and has had multiple CT scans as well as an FNA which were all nondiagnostic.  After risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the patient, an informed consent was obtained.  She was scheduled for an excisional biopsy of the right cervical lymph node.


PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
 The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  She was anesthetized with general endotracheal anesthesia.  The neck was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  Again, noted on palpation there was an enlarged level 2 cervical lymph node.

A 3-cm horizontal incision was made over this lymph node.  Dissection was carried down until the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified.  The enlarged lymph node that measured approximately 2 cm in diameter was identified and was removed and sent to Pathology for touch prep evaluation.  The area was then explored for any other enlarged lymph nodes.  None were identified, and hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery.  A quarter-inch Penrose drain was placed in the wound.

The wound was then irrigated and closed with 3-0 interrupted Vicryl sutures for a deep closure followed by a running 4-0 Prolene subcuticular suture.  Mastisol and Steri-Strip were placed over the incision, and sterile bandage was applied.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was extubated without complications and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will return to the office tomorrow in followup to have the Penrose drain removed.

REASON FOR REFERRAL:
  The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the &quot;early stages of a likely dementia&quot; and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.  Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning.  The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results.


RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  
Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.


HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:
  The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years.  She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work.  She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours.  She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services.  She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November.  She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints.  She said that they began &quot;as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off.  She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays.  She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time.  She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback.

In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time.  Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D.  He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009.  She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore.  Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence.  The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was &quot;too derogatory.&quot;  A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation.  To summarize, the results indicated &quot;diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history.  This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.&quot;  It concluded that &quot;results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy�  The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing.  The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other.  Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits.  His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable.  The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting.  A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure.


IMAGING STUDIES: 
 MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions.  Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast.


CURRENT FUNCTIONING:  
The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her.  When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills.  She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems.  She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living.  She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning.  She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.  She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician.  She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application.  Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue.  She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia.  She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year.  She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot &quot;like dragging.&quot;  Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis.  She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body.  Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip.


OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 The patient reported that her birth and development were normal.  She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.  As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia.  She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm.  MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7.  MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon.  As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991.  She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control.  She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974.  Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007.  She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
  NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C.


SUBSTANCE USE: 
 The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs.  She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  
The patient was born and raised in North Carolina.  She was the sixth of nine siblings.  Her father was a chef.  He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes.  Her mother is 93 years old.  Her last job was as a janitor.  She completed fourth grade.  She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time.  Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression.  The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979.  She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems.  She was married for two years.  Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse.  She has two children ages 43 and 30.  Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York.  In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's.  She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling.  The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years.  Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years.  She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that.  Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years.  She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past.  She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job.  In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games.


PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: 
 The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue.  She was also taking Prozac during that time.  She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation.  She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable.  When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things.  She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.

BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:
  The patient arrived unaccompanied and on time for her appointment.  She ambulated independently and no gross psychomotor abnormalities were noted.  Vision and hearing appeared to be adequate for testing.  She was neatly dressed and groomed.  Eye contact was good.  She was oriented to person, place, time, and situation.  Speech was mildly slow and a few mild articulatory errors were noted near the end of the day, and a few paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming task.  There were otherwise no apparent problems with expression and speech was normal with respect to rhythm and prosody.  She was somewhat quiet, but quite cooperative throughout the day.  Affect appeared to be mildly constricted, but she smiled and joked appropriately at times.  Mood appeared to be euthymic.  Receptive language abilities appeared to be within broad normal limits as she was able to appropriately respond to the examiner's questions and instructions.  Thought processes were linear and goal-directed and no thought disturbances were noted.  She appeared quite tired near the end of the day and it should be noted that sustained attention task was the last test that was given at the end of the day.  When asked, the patient said that she recognized some of the tests that were given, but not most of them.  She denied having look up any information on any of the tests that are typically involved in a neuropsychological battery or having any additional information about them since her last testing.  Overall, The patient appeared to put full effort into this evaluation.  She was highly motivated and thus these results should be seen as an accurate reflection of her current cognitive functioning.

Note that there was some overlap in tests that were administered during this evaluation and those given at her evaluation in August of 2009.  These include the ways for CPT II, verbal fluency, and Boston Naming Test, but this exception of the ways for most of these tests are not expected to have a significant practice effect associated with them; however, they will be interpreted with her recent evaluation in mind.

GENERAL COGNITIVE ABILITY: 
 The patient performed in the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning.  Her performances were within expected limits across subtests assessing attention, initiation, visuospatial construction, conceptualization, and memory.


INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING: 
 Based on a word reading test, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the average range.  Current intellectual functioning fell in the average range (Full Scale IQ equals 98, 45th percentile).  Her index scores also indicated average performance across tasks assessing the verbal knowledge and comprehension, visuospatial perception and reasoning, working memory (i.e. complex attention) and information processing.  Significant relative strengths were seen on tasks assessing stored verbal knowledge and nonverbal reasoning.  Significant relative weaknesses were seen on task assessing visuospatial perception and construction that included a time demand (low average).  Compared to her previous test results, the pattern of findings is quite similar with stronger performance on verbal relative to nonverbal tasks or those with significant working memory or speed demands.  However, she performed somewhat better on most of these tasks in the current evaluation.  To some degree this likely reflects measurement error and variability in addition to some practice effects, although some tests are less susceptible to such changes relative to others.


ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT: 
 The patient performed within the average range across tasks assessing word reading, sentence comprehension, and spelling skills.  Her previous evaluation referred to a number of misspellings that she had made on her list of medications and certain medical conditions and she made consistent errors again during this evaluation suggesting that she may simply have a weakness in this area.


ATTENTION: 
 Auditory working memory was within the average range.  Visual working memory was low average.  On a selective visual attention test, she demonstrated good accuracy in finding target stimuli while scanning information, although her overall speed was in the low average range.  On a continuous performance test assessing sustained attention, she also demonstrated good accuracy, although it was noted that her response time tended to be slower when stimuli were presented with a longer interstimulus interval suggesting some difficulty adapting to changes in the temporal stimulus presentation.  Note that this latter performance is entirely consistent with her previous results and taken together these results suggest that attentional abilities were generally within expectations with some mildly weaker performance for complex visual relative to verbal information.  There were inconsistencies noted in attentional abilities for both verbal and visual working memory.


INFORMATION PROCESSING SPEED: 
 As noted, the patient had some difficulty adapting to changes in stimulus presentation speed on sustained attention task and there was some suggestion in her performances that she reduced her speed in order to increase accuracy; however, basic visual scanning and sequencing and psychomotor processing were in the average to high average range.


LANGUAGE: 
 Mild articulatory and paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming test.  Verbal retrieval for phonemic or category cues were in the high average and average range respectively.  Stored verbal knowledge was in the average range with as mentioned strengths noted in vocabulary.  Those language abilities were generally within expected limits.


VISUOSPATIAL PERCEPTION AND CONSTRUCTION:  
The patient demonstrated variability in her performances on tasks assessing visuospatial perception and construction.  Basic visual perception assessed through her ability to accurately interpret angular line orientations was in the high average.  Mental organization and synthesis of parts of visual figures was in the average range on an untimed task that involved namable objects and in the low average range and relative weakness when it involved timed synthesis of shapes.

Visuospatial construction using either line drawings or blocks to match to a sample design was in the borderline to low average range.  Thus taken together, the patient demonstrated some relative weaknesses in aspects of visuospatial processing, particularly when tasks involved the time component or shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects.


LEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS:



 VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY:
  Initial acquisition of a list of 15 unrelated items within the high average range (she successfully recalled eight items).  She benefited significantly from repetition and demonstrated immediate and significant improvement in her recall, although across five learning trials, her learning curve was mildly inconsistent suggesting attentional weaknesses; however, following the fifth trial, her overall learning fell in the superior range (all 15 items were successfully recalled).  Spontaneous recall following a 20-minute delay was in the average range as she was able to remember 11 of the 15 items.  She correctly recognized all those items during recognition (high average).  Taking together these memory results are well within expected limits.  She demonstrated some mild forgetting, but still fell within the average range and was able to recognize items effectively suggesting mild weaknesses and inconsistencies with retrieval and attentional weaknesses may have contributed to variability in her learning curve initially.


 VISUAL LEARNING AND MEMORY:  
The patient' immediate recall of a complex figure was in the average range.  She retained all of that information following a delay and her recall was in the high average range.  Recognition of the individual components of the figure was impaired.  Taken together these results highlight some difficulties with complex visuospatial perception and construction, although memory per se was intact based on her very strong recall performances.  Note also that she demonstrated this strong memory despite some initial errors in her copy of the complex figure itself again highlighting difficulties with perception and construction, but good overall memory functioning.


EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING: 
 As mentioned, working memory was stronger for verbal than visual information, but both were within broad normal limits.  Verbal fluency was within expected limits as well and she demonstrated particular strength in switching between semantic categories (very superior).  Design fluency was average.  Cognitive set shifting, inhibition of prepotent responses and planning and problem solving all fell within the average to high average range and within expected limits.  Abstract reasoning for visual and verbal information was also good.  Thus taken together, the patient did not demonstrate any difficulties with tasks assessing executive functioning.


MOTOR FUNCTIONING:
  Fine motor coordination skills were within the average range with both her right dominant hand and left hand.  Strength was impaired on both sides while basic motor speed was in the borderline range for both hands.  These results are very similar to those that were found in her previous evaluation.  They are consistent with decreased strength, but no loss of dexterity and they do not suggest any lateralized deficits.


EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING:  
On an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only three items suggesting reduced energy and reduced clarity of thinking.  Overall, these results suggest that she is not experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms at this time.


SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS: 
 This is a 58-year-old African-American female with 16 years of education who is referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X in order to assess for possible cognitive impairment.  She reported that she had recently been terminated from her position as a supervisory nurse in a psychiatric hospital following a neuropsychological evaluation that concluded that she may be in the &quot;early stages of a likely dementia&quot;.

This evaluation was requested as a second opinion in order to clarify the nature of her cognitive impairment and make recommendations for ongoing treatment planning.

Overall, intellectual functioning fell in the average range on this evaluation.  Note that the same battery of tests was used in order to assess intellectual functioning and given the recency of her previous evaluation to some degree practice effects may have impacted her performance.  However, we would not expect as significant of an impact upon tasks assessing processing speed and working memory.  The same pattern of performance was noted across subtests in the intellectual battery with stronger performance on verbal knowledge based tasks relative to those assessing processing speed, working memory, and visuospatial skills.  However, during this evaluation, she demonstrated significant improvement across tasks so that in general her profile is elevated, but the same profile pattern was seen.  Note that along with practice effects, performance can also be impacted by changes in attention, as well as measurement error.  The possibility of attentional fluctuations having contributed to some of her performance is a definite possibility based on her performance on some attention tasks, which suggested that she at times performed better and was able to sequence in mind more information than she was able to passively repeat and she demonstrated inconsistencies in her learning curve on the memory task.  Our assessment of her intelligence as falling within the average range is consistent with our estimate of premorbid intellectual functioning and educational and occupational history.  Note that the ways for technical manual indicates that test retest gains are less pronounced for verbal comprehension and working memory subtests than perceptual reasoning and processing speed subtests and The patient' improvements were much higher than the mean increases in the normative sample that averaged a shorter period between testing and retesting.  This suggests that as noted above other factors were applied, perhaps including attentional fluctuations.  Relative to intellectual functioning, the patient performed within expected limits across tasks assessing language functioning, verbal and visual memory, and executive skills and sustained attention.  Variability in performances was seen for information processing speed, particularly when responding to changes in the tempo of stimulus presentation or making more complex visual discriminations.  Immediate attention was also somewhat variable as she should be able to mentally manipulate greater amounts of visual and verbal material and she could just passively replicate.  The better performance on raw scores on these more complex tasks is unusual and suggests fluctuations in attention for reasons other than brain base deficits.  She also demonstrated weaker skills in complex visuospatial processing, particularly for shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects.  Of note, she performed poorly when these tasks involved the time component.  Meteorically, she demonstrated bilateral impairments in strength and motor speed, but dexterity and fine motor manipulation skills were within expected limits.  The lack of lateralizing information and motor skills suggests that more peripheral factors and pain may have contributed to these results.  Taken together, these results do not necessarily suggest that there has been any significant decline from premorbid levels.  It is possible that the patient has always had weaknesses in visuospatial processing and note that these weaknesses were not in basic visual skills and processing skills, but rather in putting together shapes and figures.  The inconsistencies in her performances on processing speed and attention tasks suggest that while she may be somewhat slowed in completing tasks, there may be contributors other than brain base changes that impacted her results.  In particular, the patient' current medications, as well as pain, fatigue, and medical conditions such as diabetes and associated possible neuropathy are likely important factors.

Results do not suggest the presence of a progressive dementing disorder.  Given the multiple factors that may have contributed to some of our findings, we do not believe that any cognitive disorder should be diagnosed at this time.  If there are significant concerns about her cognitive functioning, it may be useful to make adjustments in her medication regimen.  This is a not a work based evaluation and therefore questions regarding her ability to perform job duties will not be addressed.  One concern that we would like to bring up is that if visuospatial problems are of newer onset, they may be contributing to her recent falls and thus should be monitored for changes and progression and she should return for reevaluation in one year's time in order to determine any changes in her cognitive functioning.  Additional recommendations are provided below.

Note that there was a little overlap in tests given between the two testing sessions aside from the ways for CPT to word fluency.  Also note that she completed the brief self-report instrument and all of her results fell within normal limits.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  Based on fluctuations in processing speed and attention, it is possible that the patient' current medications may be impacting her cognitive functioning to some degree.  Decisions regarding any changes are deferred to her physicians, but it may be useful to streamline her current medications while also continuing to effectively address symptoms.
2.  The patient should return for reevaluation in one year's time to monitor her cognitive functioning and evaluate for any improvements in performance following any medication changes.  Note also that stress related to her work situation and the nature of her previous neuropsychological evaluation may have also contributed to some of her difficulties on that testing.
3.  The nature of her frequent falls is uncertain, but it is possible that weaknesses in visuospatial processing may be contributing and this should be further evaluated by her physicians.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
Lumbar radiculopathy, 724.4.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Lumbar radiculopathy, 724.4.


PROCEDURE:
  Lumbar epidural steroid injection.


ANESTHESIOLOGIST:
  Monitored anesthesia care


INJECTATE USED:
  10 mL of 0.5% lidocaine and 80 mg of Depo-Medrol.


ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
  None.


COMPLICATIONS:
  None.


DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE:
  The patient arrived at the preoperative holding area where informed consent, stable vital signs, and intravenous access were obtained.  A thorough discussion of the potential risks, benefits, and complications was made prior to the procedure including potential for post-dural puncture headache and its associated treatment as well as potential for increased neurological dysfunction and/or nerve root injury, infection, bleeding and even death.  There were no known EKG, chest X-ray, or laboratory contraindications to the procedure.

The patient has presented with significant apprehension concerning the proposed procedure and is fearful of movement during the procedure producing further neurological injury.  Arrangements will be made to have an anesthesia care provider present to provide heavier sedation while in the prone position with optimal airway management for improved patient safety and comfort.

The L4-L5 interspace was identified fluoroscopically.  A left paramedian insertion was marked and after sedation was established by the anesthesia department the skin and subcutaneous tissue over the proposed insertion site was infiltrated with 3 millimeters of 0.5% Lidocaine initially through a #25-gauge 5/8-inch needle later a #22-gauge 1-1/2-inch needle.

A number #18-gauge Tuohy epidural needle was then inserted and advanced with fluoroscopic guidance until passing just superior to the lamina of L5.  Needle tip position was confirmed in the anterior posterior fluoroscopic view.  The epidural space was located with the loss of pulsation technique.  Aspiration of the syringe was negative for blood or cerebrospinal fluid.  One millimeter of 0.9% preservative was injected with good loss resistance noted.


DISCHARGE SUMMARY:
  Following the completion of this procedure, the patient underwent monitoring in the recovery room and was discharged, to be followed as an outpatient.

REASON FOR ADMISSION:
  Intraperitoneal chemotherapy.


HISTORY: 
 A very pleasant 63-year-old hypertensive, nondiabetic, African-American female with a history of peritoneal mesothelioma.  The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy.  Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy.  She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her.  Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol.  The patient since her last visit has done relatively well.  She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties.  She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable.  She has had no fever, chills, or sweats.  Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease.  She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen.  The report showed the following findings.  In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve.  There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node.  Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific.  No pulmonary masses were noted.  In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland.  On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted.  There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study.  A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst.  It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm.  There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable.  Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them.  There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm.  In the pelvis, there was a small amount of ascites in the right pelvis extending from the inferior right paracolic gutter.  No suspicious osseous lesions were noted.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
 Norco 10 per 325 one to two p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. pain, atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., Levoxyl 75 mcg p.o. daily, Phenergan 25 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. nausea, lorazepam 0.5 mg every 8 hours as needed for anxiety, Ventolin HFA 2 puffs q.6h. p.r.n., Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily, Cymbalta 60 mg p.o. daily, and Restoril 30 mg at bedtime as needed for sleep.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
  Kawasaki disease, resolving.


HOSPITAL COURSE:
  This is a 14-month-old baby boy Caucasian who came in with presumptive diagnosis of Kawasaki with fever for more than 5 days and conjunctivitis, mild arthritis with edema, rash, resolving and with elevated neutrophils and thrombocytosis, elevated CRP and ESR.  When he was sent to the hospital, he had a fever of 102.  Subsequently, the patient was evaluated and based on the criteria, he was started on high dose of aspirin and IVIG.  Echocardiogram was also done, which was negative.  IVIG was done x1, and between 12 hours of IVIG, he spiked fever again; it was repeated twice, and then after second IVIG, he did not spike any more fever.  Today, his fever and his rash have completely resolved.  He does not have any conjunctivitis and no redness of mucous membranes.  He is more calm and quite and taking good p.o.; so with a very close followup and a cardiac followup, he will be sent home.

        Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The Morton's neuroma was localized by careful palpation and was found to be between the 3rd and 4th metatarsal space.  The area was cleaned and subsequently a 25 gauge needle was inserted half way between the MTP heads and advanced in a vertical position down through the transverse metatarsal ligament.  0.5 mL of Depo-Medrol and 0.5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine were injected at this site after aspiration.  Postprocedure no complications were noted.  Pressure was applied for a period of two minutes and a small dressing applied.


POST PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS:
 The patient has been asked to report to us any redness, swelling, inflammation, or fevers.  The patient has been asked to restrict the use of the * extremity for the next 24 hours.

DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  
INT was placed.  The patient was in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Lidocaine 1.5% for skin wheal was made 10 cm from the midline to the bilateral L2 distal vertebral body.  A 20-gauge, 15 cm SMK needle was then directed using AP and fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip of the needle was noted to be along the distal one-third and anterior border on the lateral view and on the AP view the tip of the needle was inside the lateral third of the border of the vertebral body.  At this time a negative motor stimulation was obtained.  Injection of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plus 10 mg of Depo-Medrol was performed. Coagulation was then carried out for 90oC for 90 seconds.  At the conclusion of this, the needle under fluoroscopic guidance was withdrawn approximately 5 mm where again a negative motor stimulation was obtained and the sequence of injection and coagulation was repeated.  This was repeated one more time with a 5 mm withdrawal and coagulation.

At that time, attention was directed to the L3 body where the needle was placed to the upper one-third/distal two-thirds junction and the sequence of injection, coagulation, and negative motor stimulation with needle withdrawal one time of a 5 mm distance was repeated.  There were no compilations from this.  The patient was discharged to operating room recovery in stable condition.

DISCHARGE SUMMARY



SUMMARY OF TREATMENT PLANNING:
  This discharge is at the family's request.


IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS/OUTCOMES:

1.   Depression.
2.   High risk behavior.  

The patient easily was very depressed and anxious with paranoia.  The patient has improved, but is at high risk for relapse.  She needs RTC level of care.  


INTERVENTIONS:
  A developmentally appropriate, group-oriented therapy program was the primary treatment modality.  The attending psychiatrist provided evaluation for and management of psychotropic medications.  The clinical therapist facilitated individual, group, and family therapy.  


COURSE IN HOSPITAL:  
The patient was in the hospital from 06/11/04 until 07/13/04.  The most prominent symptoms and behaviors while the patient was here were the following: Perceptual disturbances, disorganized thoughts, she was suspicious at times, at some point she was complaining of audiovisual hallucinations.  She was quiet showing a flat affect, irritable, anxious and depressed moods, tearful at times, homesick, limited interaction with peers.  She was attending groups, however, was showing limited participation.  She was superficial, not really working too much on her issues, more focused on how soon she was going to be discharged more than working on her issues.  She stated &quot;strange feelings and sensations&quot;.  The patient has shown some improvement in general.  However, she is not completely stable yet, and she sometimes is of relapse.  She is probably just waiting for the discharge to the next level of care, which is the RTC program.  However, the patient's family will not follow our recommendations in this respect at this point.  


DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC TEST/EVALUATIONS:  
A sleep-deprived EEG was done and was normal.  EKG was also done and it seems to be grossly normal as well.  


CONSULTATIONS:  
The patient was seen by one of our medical consultants for H&P for clearance to continue psychiatric treatment.  Basic blood work was done including basic metabolic panel, CBC, TSH, UA, and urine drug screen.  Per our medical consultant, thyroid dysfunction by history, however, thyroid panel, T3, T4, and TSH results are within normal limits.  History of asthma, by history, and also history of heart murmur (not heard during H&P exam).  CBC: Hematocrit of 35.5, low; absolute monocytes of 0.5, high; otherwise essentially normal lab results.  


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:


AXIS    I: 
       Major depression, recurrent, with psychotic features.

AXIS   II:
  Deferred.

AXIS  III:
        No acute major medical conditions.

AXIS  IV: 
       Psychosocial stressors.

AXIS   V: 
        GAF: 50 to 60, current.


CONDITIONS ON DISCHARGE:  
The patient is alert, oriented to time, place, person, and situation.  She denies suicidal or homicidal ideas at present exploration.  She denies perception disturbances.  She does not seem to be responding to internal stimuli at this point.  She verbally contracted for safety.  


PROGNOSIS:  
Guarded.


DISCHARGE PLAN:  
The patient will be discharged per family's request.  She will continue treatment at hospital.  The intake appointment will be on 07/21/04 at 2:00 p.m.  

NOTE: Treatment team recommendation for the patient is RTC (Residential Treatment Center) program.  However, legal guardian will not follow our recommendations at this point.  


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
  The patient should visit her family doctor, cardiologist, and OB/GYN doctor for regular annual checkups.  She should visit all of these doctors in regard to her lab results and/or her physical (medical conditions).  Please see under consultations.  


DISCHARGE MEDICATION:
  Seroquel 25 mg p.o. a.m. #30 pills no refills; Seroquel 50 mg p.o. q.h.s; Benadryl 50 mg p.o. q. 6h p.r.n. for anxiety or agitation #30 pills; Wellbutrin XL 300 mg p.o. q.a.m.; vitamin E 400 IU p.o. q.d. #30 pills; Restoril 25 mg p.o. p.r.n. for anxiety #16 pills.  

Note: Watch for the possibility of galactorrhea.  Of note: The patient had galactorrhea (lactation) as a side effect from the use of Risperdal.  Do not give Risperdal.  

The patient and patient's legal guardian were well oriented by me, the therapist in charge, and nursing staff.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  A 61-year-old white male with a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma, diagnosed in 2001, status post autologous transplant with BEAM regimen in 04/02 followed by relapse.
2.  Allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplant from match-related brother and the patient is 53 months out from transplant.
3.  Graft versus host disease involving GI tracts, skin, and liver presently off immunosuppression.
4.  Diabetes.
5.  Bipolar disorder.
6.  Chronic muscle aches.
7.  Chronic lower extremity edema.
8.  ECOG performance status 1.


INTERIM HISTORY: 
 The patient comes to the clinic today for followup.  I am seeing him once every 4 to 8 weeks.  He is off of all immunosuppression.  He does have mild chronic GVHD but not enough to warrant any therapy and the disease has been under control and he is 4-1/2-years posttransplant.

He has multiple complaints.  He has had hematochezia.  I referred him to gastroenterology.  They did an upper and lower endoscopy.  No evidence of ulcers or any abnormality was found.  Some polyps were removed.  They were benign.  He may have mild iron deficiency, but he is fatigued and has several complaints related to his level of activity.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

1.  Paxil 40 mg once daily.
2.  Cozaar.
3.  Xanax 1 mg four times a day.
4.  Prozac 20 mg a day.
5.  Lasix 40 mg a day.
6.  Potassium 10 mEq a day.
7.  Mirapex two tablets every night.
8.  Allegra 60 mg twice a day.
9.  Avandamet 4/1000 mg daily.
10.  Nexium 20 mg a day.
11.  NovoLog 25/50.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
  Fatigue, occasional rectal bleeding, and obesity.  Other systems were reviewed and were found to be unremarkable.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

VITAL SIGNS:  Today revealed that temperature 35.8, blood pressure 120/49, pulse 85, and respirations 18.  HEENT:  Oral cavity, no mucositis.  NECK:  No nodes.  AXILLA:  No nodes.  LUNGS:  Clear.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  No palpable masses.  Morbid obesity.  EXTREMITIES:  Mild lower extremity edema.  SKIN:  Mild dryness.  CNS:  Grossly intact.


LABORATORY DATA:
  White count 4.4, hemoglobin 10.1, platelet count 132,000, sodium 135, potassium 3.9, chloride 105, bicarbonate 24, BUN 15, and creatinine 0.9.  Normal alkaline phosphatase 203, AST 58, and ALT 31.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  The patient with mantle cell lymphoma who is 4-1/2 years post allotransplant.  He is without evidence of disease at the present time.  Since he is 4-1/2 years posttransplant, I do not plan to scan him or obtain chimerisms unless there is reason to.
2.  He is slightly anemic, may be iron deficient.  He has had recurrent rectal bleeding.  I told him to take multivitamin with iron and see how that helps the anemia.
3.  Regarding the hematochezia, he had an endoscopy.  I reviewed the results from the previous endoscopy.  It appears that he has polyps, but there is no evidence of graft versus host disease.
4.  Regarding the fatigue, I just reassured him that he should increase his activity level, but I am not sure how realistic that is going to be.
5.  He is followed for his diabetes by his internist.
6.  If he should have any fever or anything suggestive of infection, I advised him to call me.  I will see him back in about 2 months from now.

 This is a 60-year-old white male with history of coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1985 with subsequent sternal dehiscence with rewiring in December 2005 and stent placement in LAD region in 2005, who developed sudden chest pain and was taken to San Jacinto via ambulance where he was diagnosed with acute MI and then went into atrial fibrillation.  An intraaortic balloon pump was placed for cardiogenic shock, and then he was transferred to the ABCD Hospital on October 22, 2006, for continued critical care.  He was in a state of cardiogenic shock and multiorgan system failure including respiratory failure and acute renal insufficiency when he was transferred.  He is currently on dialysis due to end-stage renal disease and has a tracheostomy.  He is receiving fentanyl since he has been here for back pain, leg pain, abdominal pain, and pain in the feet.  He states that he is currently in pain and the fentanyl only helps for about an hour or so before the pain resumes.  He currently rates his pain as 7 out of 10.  He denies a depressed mood or anxiety and states that he knows he is getting better.  He describes his sleep as erratic and states that he will sleep for 1 hour after giving fentanyl IV and then will wake up until he gets another fentanyl.  He has PEG for tube feeding.  He has weakness on left side of his body as well as both legs since his MI.  He has been switched from fentanyl IV q.2h. to the fentanyl patch today.

PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 Mr. T was born in Dwyne, Missouri, with no complications associated with his birth.  Originally, he was raised by both parents, but they separated at an early age.  When he was about seven years old, he was raised by his mother and stepfather.  He did not sustain a relationship with his biological father from that time on.  He stated his parents moved a lot, and because this many times he was picked on in his new environments, Mr. T stated he was, at times, a rebellious teenager, but he denied any significant inability to socialize, and denied any learning disabilities or the need for special education.

Mr. T stated his stepfather was somewhat verbally abusive, and that he committed suicide when Mr. T was 18 years old.  He graduated from high school and began work at Dana Corporation for two to three years, after which he worked as an energy, auditor for a gas company.  He then became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for approximately two years.  Mr. T was married for eleven years, and divorced in 1993.  He has a son who is currently 20 years old.  After being a home maker, Mr. T worked for his mother in a restaurant, and moved on from there to work for Borg-Warner corporation for one to two years before beginning at Plum Industries, where he worked for 14 years and worked his way up to lead engineer.

Mental Status Exam:  Mr. T presented with a hyper vigilant appearance, his eye contact was appropriate to the interview, and his motor behavior was tense.  At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.

He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.

There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.


IMPRESSIONS: 
 Major Depressive Disorder, single episode


RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: 
 I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.
