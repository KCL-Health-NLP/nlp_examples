REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
 We were asked to see the patient in regards to a brain tumor.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
She was initially diagnosed in September of this year with a glioblastoma multiforme.  She presented with several lesions in her brain and a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis.  She was seen by Dr. X in our group.  Because of her living arrangement, she elected to have treatment through the hospital radiation department and oncology department.  Details of her treatment are not available at the time of this dictation.  Her family has a packet of Temodar 100-mg pills.  She is admitted now with increasing confusion.  A CT shows increase in size of the lesions compared to the preoperative scan.  We are asked to comment on her treatment at this point.  She herself is confused and is unable to provide further history.  


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 From her old chart:  No known past medical history prior to the diagnosis.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  
She was living alone and is now living in assisted living.  


MEDICATIONS

1.  Dilantin 300 mg daily.
2.  Haloperidol 1 mg h.s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

GENERAL:  Elderly woman, confused.  
HEENT:  Normal conjunctivae.  Ears and nose normal.  Mouth normal.
NECK:  Supple.
CHEST: Clear.
HEART:  Normal.
ABDOMEN: Soft, positive bowel sounds.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert, cranial nerves intact.  Left arm slightly weak.  Left leg slightly weak.


IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
  Glioblastoma multiforme, uncertain as to where she is in cancer treatment.  Given the number of pills in the patient's family's hands, it sounds like she has only been treated recently and therefore it is not surprising that she is showing increased problems related to increased size of the tumor.  We will have to talk with Dr. Y in the Clinic to get a better handle on her treatment regimen.  At this point, I will hold Temodar today and consider restarting it tomorrow if we can get her treatment plan clarified.

HISTORY: 
 The patient is a 4-day-old being transferred here because of hyperbilirubinemia and some hypoxia.  Mother states that she took the child to the clinic this morning since the child looked yellow and was noted to have a bilirubin of 23 mg%.  The patient was then sent to Hospital where she had some labs drawn and was noted to be hypoxic, but her oxygen came up with minimal supplemental oxygen.  She was also noted to have periodic breathing.  The patient is breast and bottle-fed and has been feeding well.  There has been no diarrhea or vomiting.  Voiding well.  Bowels have been regular.

According to the report from referring facility, because the patient had periodic breathing and was hypoxic, it was thought the patient was septic and she was given a dose of IM ampicillin.

The patient was born at 37 weeks' gestation to gravida 3, para 3 female by repeat C-section.  Birth weight was 8 pounds 6 ounces and the mother's antenatal other than was normal except for placenta previa.  The patient's mother apparently went into labor and then underwent a cesarean section.

EXTREMITIES:  The patient moves all extremities well.  Has a normal tone and a good suck.


EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: 
 It was indicated to the parents that I would be repeating labs and also catheterize urine specimen.  Parents were made aware of the fact that child did have a murmur.  I spoke to Dr. X, who suggested doing an EKG, which was normal and since the patient will be admitted for hyperbilirubinemia, an echo could be done in the morning.  The case was discussed with Dr. Y and he will be admitting this child for hyperbilirubinemia.

CBC done showed a white count of 15,700, hemoglobin 18 gm%, hematocrit 50.6%, platelets 245,000, 10 bands, 44 segs, 34 lymphs, and 8 monos.  Chemistries done showed sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium 4.5 mEq/L, chloride 104 mEq/L, CO2 28 mmol/L, glucose 75 mg%, BUN 8 mg%, creatinine 0.7 mg%, and calcium 8.0 mg%.  Total bilirubin was 25.4 mg, all of which was unconjugated.  CRP was 0.3 mg%.  Blood culture was drawn.  Catheterized urine specimen was normal.  Parents were kept abreast of what was going on all the time and the need for admission.  Phototherapy was instituted in the ER almost after the baby got to the emergency room.

REASON FOR VISIT:
  Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  Briefly, a 16-year-old right-handed boy who is in eleventh grade, who presents with some blurred vision and visual acuity difficulties, was found to have a suprasellar tumor.  He was brought to the operating room on 01/04/07, underwent a transsphenoidal resection of tumor.  Histology returned as craniopharyngioma.  There is some residual disease; however, the visual apparatus was decompressed.  According to him, he is doing well, back at school without any difficulties.  He has some occasional headaches and tinnitus, but his vision is much improved.


MEDICATIONS: 
 Synthroid 100 mcg per day.


FINDINGS: 
 On exam, he is awake, alert and oriented x 3.  Pupils are equal and reactive.  EOMs are full.  His visual acuity is 20/25 in the right (improved from 20/200) and the left is 20/200 improved from 20/400.  He has a bitemporal hemianopsia, which is significantly improved and wider.  His motor is 5 out of 5.  There are no focal motor or sensory deficits.  The abdominal incision is well healed.  There is no evidence of erythema or collection.  The lumbar drain was also well healed.

The postoperative MRI demonstrates small residual disease.

Histology returned as craniopharyngioma.


ASSESSMENT: 
 Postoperative visit for craniopharyngioma with residual disease.


PLANS: 
 I have recommended that he call.  I discussed the options with our radiation oncologist, Dr. X. They will schedule the appointment to see him.  In addition, he probably will need an MRI prior to any treatment, to follow the residual disease.

PROBLEMS AND ISSUES:

1.  Headaches, nausea, and dizziness, consistent with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, recommend amitriptyline for prophylactic treatment and Motrin for abortive treatment.
2.  Some degree of peripheral neuropathy, consistent with diabetic neuropathy, encouraged her to watch her diet and exercise daily.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness.  I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination.  I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today.  I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her.

Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25.  She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent.  They were pulsating.  She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms.  After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches.  In 2004, her headaches returned.  She also noted that she had &quot;zig-zag lines&quot; in her vision.  Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions.  She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness.  On one occasion she almost had a syncope.  Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her.  The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week.  They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis.


MEDICATIONS:
  Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa.


ALLERGIES: 
 She has no known drug allergies.


FAMILY HISTORY:  
There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 She drinks alcohol occasionally.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms.  Remainder of her full 14-point review of system was unremarkable.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  On examination, the patient was pleasant.  She was able to speak English fairly well.  Her blood pressure was 130/84.  Heart rate was 80.  Respiratory rate was 16.  Her weight was 188 pounds.  Her pain score was 0/10.  Her general exam was completely unremarkable.  Her neurological examination showed subtle weakness in her left arm due to discomfort and pain.  She had reduced vibration sensation in her left ankle and to some degree in her right foot.  There was no ataxia.  She was able to walk normally.  Reflexes were 2+ throughout.

She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's was unremarkable.  She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable.


IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
  The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s.  She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms.  Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine.  I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, M&eacute;ni&egrave;re's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.

I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet.  I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine.  I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit.  I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time.  She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches.

She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms.  I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which helps to reduce migraine symptoms.

The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.  The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the spine and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.  With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, was gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerves from the Dorsal Ramus of ***.  Specifically, each needle tip was inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebrae at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen.  Needle localization was confirmed with AP and lateral radiographs.

The following technique was used to confirm placement at the Medial Branch nerves.  Sensory stimulation was applied to each level at 50 Hz; paresthesias were noted at
*** volts.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration; corresponding paraspinal muscle twitching without extremity movement was noted at *** volts.

Following this, the needle Trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 1cc 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the Medial Branch nerve and surrounding tissue.  After completion of each nerve block a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds.  All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.


COMPLICATIONS:
  None.  No complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition.


DISCUSSION: 
 Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.

The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.

Follow up appointment was made in approximately 1 week.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  This is a 41-year-old registered nurse (R.N.).  She was admitted following an overdose of citalopram and warfarin.  The patient has had increasing depression and has been under stress as a result of dissolution of her second marriage.  She notes starting in January, her husband of five years seemed to be quite withdrawn.  It turned out, he was having an affair with one of her best friends and he subsequently moved in with this woman.  The patient is distressed, as over the five years of their marriage, she has gotten herself into considerable debt supporting him and trying to find a career that would work for him.  They had moved to ABCD where he had recently been employed as a restaurant manager.  She also moved her mother and son out there and is feeling understandably upset that he was being dishonest and deceitful with her.  She has history of seasonal affective disorder, winter depressions, characterized by increased sleep, increased irritability, impatience, and fatigue.  Some suggestion on her part that her father may have had some mild bipolar disorder and including the patient has a cyclical and recurrent mood disorder.  In January, she went on citalopram.  She reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, has trouble sleeping at night, thinks perhaps her mood got worse on the citalopram, which is possible, though it is also possible that the progressive nature of getting divorce than financial problems has contributed to her worsening mood.


PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: 
 She was born in XYZ.  She describes the family as being somewhat dysfunctional.  Father was a truckdriver.  She is an only child.  She reports that she had a history of anorexia and bulimia as a teenager.  In her 20s, she served six years in Naval Reserve.  She was previously married for four years.  She described that as an abusive relationship.  She had a history of being in counseling with ABC, but does not think this therapist, who is now by her estimate 80 years old, is still in practice.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  

GENERAL:  This is an alert and cooperative woman.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 60, respirations 18, blood pressure 95/54, oxygen saturation 95%, and weight is 132.
PSYCHIATRIC:  She makes good eye contact.  Speech is normal in rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary.  There is no thought disorder.  She denies being suicidal.  Her affect is appropriate for material being discussed.  She has a sense of future, wants to get back to work, has plans to return to counseling.  She appeared to have normal orientation, concentration, memory, and judgment.

Medical history is notable for factor V Leiden deficiency, history of pulmonary embolus, restless legs syndrome.  She has been off her Mirapex.  I did encourage her to go back on the Mirapex, which would likely lead to some improvement in mood by facilitating better sleep.

The patient at this time can contract for safety.  She has made plans for outpatient counseling this Saturday and we will get a referral to a psychiatrist for which she is agreeable to following up with.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 INR, which is still 8.8.  In 1998, she had a normal MRI.  Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and CBC were all normal.


DIAGNOSES:  

1.  Seasonal depressive disorder.
2.  Restless legs syndrome.
3.  Overdose of citalopram and warfarin.


RECOMMENDATIONS: 
 The patient reports she has been feeling better since discontinuing antidepressants.  I, therefore, recommend she stay off antidepressants at present.  If needed, she can take Prozac, which has been effective for her in the past and she plans to see a psychiatrist for consultation.  She does give a fairly good history of seasonal depression and given that her mood has improved in the past with Prozac, this will be an appropriate agent to try as needed in the future, but given the situational nature of the depression, she primarily appears to need counseling.

Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if there is additional information I can provide.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Right axillary adenopathy.
2.  Thrombocytopenia.
3.  Hepatosplenomegaly.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Right axillary adenopathy.
2.  Thrombocytopenia.
3.  Hepatosplenomegaly.


PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  
Right axillary lymph node biopsy.


ANESTHESIA: 
 Local with sedation.


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


DISPOSITION: 
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.


BRIEF HISTORY:  
The patient is a 37-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital secondary to hiccups and was ultimately found to have a right axillary mass to be severely thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 2000 as well as having hepatosplenomegaly.  The working diagnosis is lymphoma, however, the Hematology and Oncology Departments were requesting a lymph node biopsy in order to confirm the diagnosis as well as prognosis.  Thus, the patient was scheduled for a lymph node biopsy with platelets running secondary to thrombocytopenia at the time of surgery.


INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: 
 The patient was found to have a large right axillary lymphadenopathy, one of the lymph node was sent down as a fresh specimen.


PROCEDURE:  
After informed written consent, risks and benefits of this procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to the operating suite, prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion.  Multiple lymph nodes were palpated in the right axilla, however, the most inferior node was to be removed.  First, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine solution.  Next, using a #15 blade scalpel, an incision was made approximately 4 cm in length transversally in the inferior axilla.  Next, using electro Bovie cautery, maintaining hemostasis, dissection was carried down to the lymph node.  The lymph node was then completely excised using electro Bovie cautery as well as hemostats to maintain hemostasis and then lymph node was sent to specimen fresh to the lab.  Several hemostats were used, suture ligated with #3-0 Vicryl suture and hemostasis was maintained.  Next the deep dermal layers were approximated with #3-0 Vicryl suture.  After the wound has been copiously irrigated, the skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture and the pathology is pending.  The patient did tolerated the procedure well.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to the Recovery in stable condition.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
 Glioma.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  The patient is a 71-year-old woman who was initially diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1982.  She underwent radiation therapy for this, although craniotomy was not successful for a biopsy because of seizure activity during the surgery.  She did well for the next 10 years or so, and developed Parkinson disease, possibly related to radiation therapy.  She has been followed by neurology, Dr. Z, to treat seizure activity.  She has a vagal stimulator in place to help control her seizure activity.

Over the last few months, she has had increasing weakness on the right side.  She has been living in a nursing home.  She has not been able to walk, and she has not been able to write for the past three to four years.

MRI scan done on 11/13/2006 showed increase in size of the abdominal area and the left parietal region.  There was slight enhancement and appearance was consistent with a medium- to low-grade tumor anterior to the motor cortex.

Surgery was performed during this admission to remove some of the posterior part of the tumor.  She tolerated the procedure well.  She has noticed no worsening or improvement in her weakness.  Pathology shows a low- to intermediate-grade glioma.  The second opinion by Dr. A is still pending.

The patient is feeling well today.  She is not having headache, and reports no new neurologic symptoms.  She has not had leg swelling, cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  

1.  Ambien p.r.n.  
2.  Vicodin p.r.n.  
3.  Actonel every Sunday.  
4.  Colace.  
5.  Felbatol 1200 mg b.i.d.  
6.  Heparin injections for prophylaxis.  
7.  Maalox p.r.n.  
8.  Mirapex 0.5 mg t.i.d.  
9.  Protonix 40 mg daily.  
10.  Tylenol p.r.n.  
11.  Zanaflex 4-mg tablet, one-half tablet daily and 6 mg at bedtime.  
12.  She has Zofran p.r.n., albuterol inhaler q.i.d., and Aggrenox, which she is to start.

The rest of the history is mostly from the chart.


ALLERGIES: 
 SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  

1.  Parkinson's, likely secondary to radiation therapy.
2.  History of prior stroke.
3.  Seizure disorder secondary to her brain tumor.
4.  History of urinary incontinence.
5.  She has had hip fractures x2, which have required surgical pinning.
6.  Appendectomy.
7.  Cholecystectomy.


SOCIAL HISTORY:
  Shows that she does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.  She lives in a nursing home.


FAMILY HISTORY:
  Shows a family history of breast cancer.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  
GENERAL:  Today, she is sitting up in the chair, alert, and appropriate.  She tends to lean towards the right.  The right arm and hand are noticeably weaker than the left.  She is quite thin.
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 98.5, blood pressure is 138/75, pulse is 76, respirations are 16, and pulse oximetry is 92% on room air.
HEENT:  There is a craniotomy incision on the left parietal region, clean, and dry with stitches still in place.  The oropharynx shows no thrush or mucositis.
LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally to auscultation.
CARDIAC:  Exam shows regular rate.
ABDOMEN:  Soft.
EXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema or evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is noted on the lower extremities.


IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
  Progressive low-grade glioma, now more than 20 years since initially diagnosed.  She is status post craniotomy for debulking and has done well with the surgery.

We reviewed the phase II trials that have used Temodar in the setting of grade 2 gliomas.  Although, complete responses are rare, it is quite common to have partial response and/or stable disease, and most patients had improved quality of life indices including many patients who benefit from decreased seizure activity.  We discussed using Temodar after she heals from her surgery.  Toxicities would include fatigue, nausea, and myelosuppression primarily.

The patient's insurance is through SecureHorizons plan which we do not accept at our office, so I would discuss with Dr. Y setting her up to see another oncologist.  In the meantime, we can investigate the cost of Temodar to her, I suspect she may have a 20% copay.

She is anxious to have the Foley catheter removed before she goes to her nursing home tomorrow.  She normally does not have a Foley catheter in place.  Orders have already been written by Dr. Y to have it removed.

2.  Umbilical hernia.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES

1.  Adrenal mass, right sided.
2.  Umbilical hernia.


OPERATION PERFORMED: 
 Laparoscopic hand-assisted left adrenalectomy and umbilical hernia repair.


ANESTHESIA:  
General.


CLINICAL NOTE: 
 This is a 52-year-old inmate with a 5.5 cm diameter nonfunctioning mass in his right adrenal.  Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required.  Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion.


DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  
In the right flank-up position, table was flexed.  He had a Foley catheter in place.  Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter.  The umbilical hernia was taken down.  An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin.  A liver retractor was placed to this.

The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt.  The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly.  The vena cava was identified.  The main renal vein was identified.  Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided.  Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie.  The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally.  Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided.  Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact.

Hemostasis was excellent.

The umbilical hernia had been completely taken down.  The edges were freshened up.  Vicryl #1 was utilized to close the incision and 2-0 Vicryl was used to close the fascia of the trocar.

Skin closed with clips.

He tolerated the procedure well.  All sponge and instrument counts were correct.  Estimated blood loss less than 100 mL.

The patient was awakened, extubated, and returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 Mental status changes after a fall.


HISTORY: 
 Ms. ABC is a 76-year-old female with Alzheimer's, apparently is normally very talkative, active, independent, but with advanced Alzheimer's.  Apparently, she tripped backwards hitting her head on a wheelchair and, had although no loss consciousness, had altered mental status changes.  She was very confused, incomprehensible speech, and was not responding appropriately.  She was transported here stable, with no significant changes.  She ultimately upon arrival here was unchanged in that she was not responding appropriately.  She would have garbled speech, somewhat inappropriate at times, and unable to follow commands.  No other history was able to be obtained.  All pertinent history is documented within the records.  Physical examination also documented in the records, essentially as above.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 HEENT:  Without any obvious signs of trauma.  Pupils are equal and reactive.  Extraocular movements are difficult to assess with her eyes closed, but she will open to voice.  TMs, canals are normal without any signs of hemotympanum.  Nasal mucosa and oropharynx are normal.
NECK:  Nontender, full range of motion, was not examined initially, a collar was placed.
HEART:  Regular.
LUNGS:  Clear.
CHEST/BACK/ABDOMEN:  Without trauma.
SKIN:  With multiple excoriations from scratching and itching.
NEUROLOGIC:  Otherwise she has good sensation, withdrawals to pain.  When lifting the arm, she will hold them up and draw, let them down slowly.  With movement of the legs, she did straighten them back out slowly.  DTRs were intact and equal bilaterally.  Otherwise, the remainder of the examination was unable to be done because of patient's non-cooperation and mental status change.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 CT scan of the head was negative as was cervical spine.  She has a history of being on Coumadin.  Her INR is 1.92, CBC was with a white count of 3.8, 50% neutrophils, 8% bands.  CMP did note a potassium, which was elevated at 5.9, troponin was normal, mag is 2.5, valproic acid level 24.3.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
 Ms. ABC is a 76-year-old female with multiple medical problems who has sustained a head injury with mental status changes that on repeat examination now at approximately 1930 hours, has completely resolved.  It is likely she sustained a concussion with postconcussive symptoms and syndrome that has resolved.  At this time, she has some other abnormalities in her lab work and I recommend she be admitted for observation and further investigation.  I have discussed this with her son, he agrees.  Otherwise, she has improved significantly.  The patient was discussed with XYZ, who will admit the patient for further evaluation and treatment.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:

1.  Extensive stage small cell lung cancer.
2.  Chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide.
3.  Left scapular pain status post CT scan of the thorax.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a 67-year-old female with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.  She is currently receiving treatment with carboplatin and etoposide.  She completed her fifth cycle on 08/12/10.  She has had ongoing back pain and was sent for a CT scan of the thorax.  She comes into clinic today accompanied by her daughters to review the results.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
 Levothyroxine 88 mcg daily, Soriatane 25 mg daily, Timoptic 0.5% solution b.i.d., Vicodin 5/500 mg one to two tablets q.6 hours p.r.n.


ALLERGIES: 
 No known drug allergies.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
The patient continues to have back pain some time she also take two pain pill.  She received platelet transfusion the other day and reported mild fever.  She denies any chills, night sweats, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  The rest of her review of systems is negative.


PHYSICAL EXAM:

VITALS:    BP:  118/60.  HEART RATE:  76.  TEMP:  97.8.  Weight:  65.5 kg.
GEN:      She looks well, in no acute distress.
HEENT:    Her pupils were noted for surgical changes bilaterally.  Oropharynx is clear.
NECK:    Supple.  She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.
LUNGS:    Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV:    Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN:    Soft.  He has positive bowel sounds.
EXT:    Lower extremities are without edema.


IMAGING: 
 Her CT scan shows a pleural base mass in the left apex appears to have some growth along the medial margin comparing with PET/CT assessment 07/08/10.  While this extends to the pleural surface it does not clearly invade directly into the chest wall or the adjacent posterior lateral left third rib.  Left suprahilar and mediastinal adenopathy appears to be essentially stable since 07/08/10.  Multilevel thoracic bony metastatic disease is present.  Hypodense liver metastasis appears slightly improved comparing with July, more substantially improved comparing with chest CT of 04/21/10.


ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
  This is a very pleasant female 67-year-old female with extensive stage small cell lung cancer.  She had one treatment postponed due to counts.  She had low blood counts this week requiring platelet transfusion, so we are going to dose reduce for six treatments by 10%.  As far as the back pain, she clearly has evidence of progressive bone metastasis in T3, T11, T12, and T1 and questions about the soft tissue mass pleural base mass in the lateral left apex.  I am going to refer back to Dr. X to see if there might be some palliative radiation to deal with the left back and scapular region.

Her swallowing mechanism does not appear to be very functional, and therefore, it was felt that in order to aid in her home care that she would be better served with a gastrostomy.


OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  
After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in usual manner.  Transverse left upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection.  The muscle was divided and the peritoneal cavity entered.  The greater curvature of the stomach was grasped with a Babcock clamp and brought into the operative field.  The site for gastrostomy was selected and a pursestring suture of #4-0 Nurolon placed in the gastric wall.  A 14-French 0.8 cm Mic-Key tubeless gastrostomy button was then placed into the stomach and the pursestring secured about the tube.  Following this, the stomach was returned to the abdominal cavity and the posterior fascia was closed using a #4-0 Nurolon affixing the stomach to the posterior fascia.  The anterior fascia was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue with the same, and the skin closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl.  The balloon was inflated to the full 5 mL.  A sterile dressing was then applied and the child awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Left axillary adenopathy.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Left axillary adenopathy.


PROCEDURE: 
 Left axillary lymph node excisional biopsy.


ANESTHESIA:
  LMA.


INDICATIONS: 
 Patient is a very pleasant woman who in 2006 had breast conservation therapy with radiation only.  Note, she refused her CMF adjuvant therapy and this was for a triple-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast.  Patient has been following with Dr. Diener and Dr. Wilmot.  I believe that genetic counseling had been recommended to her and obviously the CMF was recommended, but she declined both.  She presented to the office with left axillary adenopathy in view of the high-risk nature of her lesion.  I recommended that she have this lymph node removed.  The procedure, purpose, risk, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with her and she was agreeable to surgery.


TECHNIQUE: 
 Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, her left chest, neck, axilla, and arm were prepped with Betadine solution, draped in a sterile fashion.  An incision was made at the hairline, carried down by sharp dissection through the clavipectoral fascia.  I was able to easily palpate the lymph node and grasp it with a figure-of-eight 2-0 silk suture and by sharp dissection, was carried to hemoclip all attached structures.  The lymph node was excised in its entirety.  The wound was irrigated.  The lymph node sent to pathology.  The wound was then closed.  Hemostasis was assured and the patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.

REASON FOR VISIT: 
 Followup of laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a delightful baby girl, who is now nearly 8 months of age and had a tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis.  Laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty.  Dr. X is following The patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber.

The patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10/05/2007.  She has done well since that time.  She has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable.  She also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved.  The patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by G-tube.  She seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools.  Her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site.

The patient's exam today is excellent.  Her belly is soft and nontender.  All of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration, but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.  We removed The patient's gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty.  The site of the gastrostomy is excellent.  There is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema, and I am very happy with the overall appearance.


IMPRESSION: 
 The patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy.  Hopefully, the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal, and if she does well, allow decannulation in the future.  If she does require laryngotracheoplasty, the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well.


PLAN:  
The patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy.  We will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.

BILATERAL SACROILIAC JOINT INJECTIONS



PROCEDURE:
:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  The patient was placed in the prone position.  After preparation and local anesthetic administration, and image intensifier control a 25 gauge spinal needle was directed into the inferior aspect of the sacroiliac joint using a posterior approach.  A small amount of contrast material was administered to outline the recesses of the joints.  Verification of the initial needle position with contrast administration, 1 mL of solution was administered at this site after aspiration, consisting of 0.5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine and 0.5 mL of Celestone.  Postprocedure, the needles were withdrawn and dressing was applied.  Postprocedure no complications were noted.


POST PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS:
 The patient has been asked to report to us any redness, swelling, inflammation, or fevers.  The patient has been asked to restrict the use of the * extremity for the next 24 hours.

INDICATIONS:
 The patient is here today after establishing care at my new office.  She is a long-term patient of mine at the Pain Management Clinic and has requested transference because of insurance reasons.  Today, she is here for not only establishment of care, but continued management of her many neck-related complaints.  Among these are spasms and ongoing pain for which she receives long-acting opioids.  She states that she is in fact doing quite well since her cervical fusion.  She is requesting that we decrease her medications from 480 mg to 240 mg to 360 mg of morphine per day in the form of Avinza.  She also is quite pleased with her other medication regimen which has been greatly simplified over the past year.

Other treatment modalities that have been helpful have included cervical epidural steroid injections.  The patient is requesting that we schedule this as well, as the relief provided by that lasted anywhere from four to six months.  I agree that because of intermittent radicular symptoms that this may be helpful particularly in light of her recent surgery.  She does complain of hand tingling and numbness, although she is not dropping objects or having difficulties with coordination.  I believe that in addition, the steroid injections may help expedite her desire to decrease her reliance on medications which have been oversedating as well as racked with other side effects.


DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: 
 Alcohol prep and sterile technique were used. A total of 6 cc of preservative-free 1% lidocaine was used and injected into eight different sites using a 25-gauge, 1-1/2-inch needle at the trapezius muscles bilaterally as well as the levator scapulae, the splenius capitis, and the semispinalis musculature.  The procedure was well tolerated.


TREATMENT PLAN:

1. The patient is tentatively scheduled for a cervical epidural steroid injection on March 14, 2005.
2. We will begin a weaning schedule for the patient's Avinza by decreasing in 60 mg intervals.  The patient will have a target of 120 mg p.o. b.i.d., and then be reassessed.  This is expected to occur after her cervical epidural steroid injection.

CONFORMAL SIMULATION WITH COPLANAR BEAMS


This patient is undergoing a conformal simulation as the method to precisely define the area of disease which needs to be treated.  It allows us to highly focus the beam of radiation and shape the beam to the target volume, delivering a homogenous dosage through it while sparing the surrounding, more radiosensitive, normal tissues.  This will allow us to give the optimum chance of tumor control while minimizing the acute and long-term side effects.

A conformal simulation is a simulation which involves extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist time and effort.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room, where appropriate markers are placed, and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  One then approximates the field sizes and arrangements (gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields).  Radiographs are taken, and these fields are marked on the patient's skin.  The patient is then transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are then performed through the targeted area.  The CT scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist, and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on each slice of the CT scan.  The dosimetrist then evaluates each individual slice in the treatment planning computer with the appropriately marked structures.  This volume is then reconstructed in 3-dimensional space.  Utilizing the beam's-eye view features, the appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide homogenous coverage of the target volume while minimizing the dose to normal structures.  Once all appropriate beam parameters and isodate distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, each individual slice is then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, Cerrobend blocks will be custom fabricated.
If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where the computer-designed fields are re-simulated.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 Newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia; extensive deep vein thrombosis, right iliac vein and inferior vena cava (IVC), status post balloon angioplasty, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis following placement of a vena caval filter.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient was transferred here the evening of 02/23/2007 from Hospital with a new diagnosis of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on confirmation by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphoblasts that afternoon.  History related to this illness probably dates back to October of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual &quot;lump&quot; posteriorly.  The left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since.  In early November, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain.  Physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved.  In December, he noted onset of increasing fatigue.  He used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities.  He has lost 10 pounds since December and feels his appetite has decreased.  Night sweats and cough began in December, for which he was treated with a course of Augmentin.  However, both of these problems have continued.  He also began taking Accutane for persistent acne in December (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007).  Despite increasing fatigue and lethargy, he continues his studies at University of Denver, has a biology major (he aspires to be an ophthalmologist).

The morning of 02/19/2007, he awakened with severe right inguinal and right lower quadrant pain.  He was seen in Emergency Room where it was noted that he had an elevated WBC of 18,000.  CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that CT, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found.  He promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis.  Repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued.  Because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected.  Appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a PET/CT scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation.  This study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity.  Because the WBC continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, Sheryl Asplund, M.D., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood.  These studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  The patient was transferred here after stopping of the continuous infusion heparin and receiving a dose of Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously for further diagnostic evaluation and management of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).


ALLERGIES: 
 NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.  HE DOES SEEM TO REACT TO CERTAIN ADHESIVES.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  

1.  Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously q.12h. initiated.
2.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o., was administered on 02/19/2007 and 02/22/2007.
3.  Protonix 40 mg intravenous (IV) daily.
4.  Vicodin p.r.n.
5.  Levaquin 750 mg IV on 02/23/2007.

His paternal grandfather died of colon cancer at age 73, which he had had since age 68.  Adult-onset diabetes is present in distant relatives on both sides.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  
The patient is a student at the University majoring in biology.  He lives in a dorm there.  His parents live in Breckenridge.  He admits to having smoked marijuana off and on with friends and drinking beer off and on as well.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 He has had emesis off and on related to Vicodin and constipation since 02/19/2007, also related to pain medication.  He has had acne for about two years, which he describes as mild to moderate.  He denied shortness of breath, chest pain, hemoptysis, dyspnea, headaches, joint pains, rashes, except where he has had dressings applied, and extremity pain except for the right leg pain noted above.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
  New diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history who has now been diagnosed with a new non-small cell lung cancer stage IV metastatic disease.  We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.

ABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain.  Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened.  Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room.  A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease.  At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation.  On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes.  The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum.  This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery.  There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region.  There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm.  There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease.  There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base.  There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing.  There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax.  In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor.  All other structures appeared normal.  On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed.  Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.

On further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite.  He has not ever had a chronic smoker's cough and still does not have a cough.  He has no sputum production or hemoptysis.  He and his wife are very anxious about this diagnosis.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 He denies any history of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hepatitis major infection, seizure disorders or other problems.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 
 He denies having any surgeries.


ALLERGIES: 
 No known drug allergies.


MEDICATIONS:
  At home he takes no medication except occasional aspirin or ibuprofen, recently for his flank pain.  He does take a multivitamin on occasion.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has about a 30-pack-a-year history of smoking.  He used to drink alcohol heavily and has a history of getting a DUI about a year-and-half ago resulting in him having his truck-driving license revoked.  Since that time he has worked with printing press.  He is married and has two children, both of whom are grown in their 20s, but are now living at home.


FAMILY HISTORY: 
 His mother died for alcohol-related complications.  He otherwise denies any history of cancers, bleeding disorders, clotting disorders, or other problems.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 GENERAL/CONSTITUTIONAL:  He has lost about 20 pounds of weight as described above.  He also has a trouble with fatigue.  No lightheadedness or dizziness.  HEENT:  He denies any new or changing headache, change in vision, double vision, or loss of vision, ringing in his ears, loss of hearing in one year.  He does not take care of his teeth very well but currently he has no mouth, jaw, or teeth pain.  RESPIRATORY:  He has had some little bit of dyspnea on exertion but otherwise denies shortness of breath at rest.  No cough, congestion, wheezing, hemoptysis, and sputum production.

LABORATORY DATA: 
 His white blood cell count is 9.4, hemoglobin 13.0, hematocrit 38%, and platelets 365,000.  The differential shows 73% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 7.6% monocytes, 1.9% eosinophils, and 0.7% basophils.  Chemistry shows sodium 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, CO2 of 31, BUN 9, creatinine 1.0, glucose 104, calcium 12.3, alkaline phosphatase 104, AST 16, ALT 12, total protein 7.6, albumin 3.5, total bilirubin 0.5, ionized calcium 1.7.  His INR is 1.0 with the PT of 11.4 and a PTT of 31.3.


IMAGINING DATA:
  MRI of the brain on 12/23/08 - this shows some mild white matter disease, question of minimal pontine ischemic gliosis as well as a small incidental venous angioma in the left posterior frontal deep white matter.  There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.


ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 
 ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.  At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.  His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis.  They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease.  I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease.  Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival.  At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.

In terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal.  I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine.  This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8.  This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days.  The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.

In terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging.  A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.

At this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain.  He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control.  As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday.  At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.

Thank you very much for this interesting consult.

PROCEDURE:
 Delayed primary chest closure.


INDICATIONS: 
 The patient is a newborn with diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome who 48 hours prior to the current procedure has undergone a modified stage 1 Norwood operation.  Given the magnitude of the operation and the size of the patient (2.5 kg), we have elected to leave the chest open to facilitate postoperative management.  He is now taken back to the operative room for delayed primary chest closure.


PREOP DX: 
 Open chest status post modified stage 1 Norwood operation.


POSTOP DX:
  Open chest status post modified stage 1 Norwood operation.


ANESTHESIA: 
 General endotracheal.


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


FINDINGS:
  No evidence of intramediastinal purulence or hematoma.  He tolerated the procedure well.


DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position.  Following general endotracheal anesthesia, the chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The previously placed AlloDerm membrane was removed.  Mediastinal cultures were obtained, and the mediastinum was then profusely irrigated and suctioned.  Both cavities were also irrigated and suctioned.  The drains were flushed and repositioned.  Approximately 30 cubic centimeters of blood were drawn slowly from the right atrial line.  The sternum was then smeared with a vancomycin paste.  The proximal aspect of the 5 mm RV-PA conduit was marked with a small titanium clip at its inferior most aspect and with an additional one on its rightward inferior side.  The sternum was then closed with stainless steel wires followed by closure of subcutaneous tissues with interrupted monofilament stitches.  The skin was closed with interrupted nylon sutures and a sterile dressing was placed.  The peritoneal dialysis catheter, atrial and ventricular pacing wires were removed.  The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive unit shortly thereafter in very stable condition.

I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.

HDR BRACHYTHERAPY


The intracavitary brachytherapy applicator was placed appropriately and secured after the patient was identified.  Simulation films were obtained, documenting its positioning.  The 3-dimensional treatment planning process was accomplished utilizing the CT derived data.  A treatment plan was selected utilizing sequential dwell positions within a single catheter.  The patient was taken to the treatment area.  The patient was appropriately positioned and the position of the intracavitary device was checked.  Catheter length measurements were taken.  Appropriate measurements of the probe dimensions and assembly were also performed.  The applicator was attached to the HDR after-loader device.  The device ran through its checking sequences appropriately and the brachytherapy was then delivered without difficulty or complication.  The brachytherapy source was appropriately removed back to the brachytherapy safe within the device.  Radiation screening was performed with the Geiger-Muller counter both prior to and after the brachytherapy procedure was completed and the results were deemed appropriate.

Following completion of the procedure, the intracavitary device was removed without difficulty.  The patient was in no apparent distress and was discharged home.

PROCEDURE:
:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  Special mention was made of the possibility of infection and necrosis of the heel pad.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The tender area in the medial aspect of the heel was identified by palpation.  After proper preparation with antiseptic solution of the skin, a syringe containing 2 mL of 1% lidocaine was attached to 1.5&quot; 27 gauge needle.  The needle was carefully advanced through the carefully identified point at a right angle to the skin, directly towards the central and medial aspect of the calcaneus.  The needle was advanced very slowly until the needle impinged on the bone, and then was withdrawn slowly.  The contents of the syringe were then gently injected.  Subsequently, the needle was left in place and a syringe containing 2 mL of 0.25% Marcaine and 1 mL of Depo-Medrol was attached to the needle and injected after aspiration at this site.  Subsequently the needle was removed.  Pressure was applied at the site of insertion and once it was made sure there was no bleeding taking place, a small bandage was applied.


POST PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS:
 The patient has been asked to report to us any redness, swelling, inflammation, or fevers.  The patient has been asked to restrict the use of the * extremity for the next 24 hours.

IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENT: 
 The patient is a 34-year-old Caucasian female.


CHIEF COMPLAINT:
  Depression.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  The patient's depression began in her teenage years.  Sleep has been poor, for multiple reasons.  She has obstructive sleep apnea, and has difficulties with a child who has insomnia related to medications that he takes.  The patient tends to feel irritable, and has crying spells.  She sometimes has problems with motivation.  She has problems with memory, and energy level is poor. Appetite has been poor, but without weight change.  Because of her frequent awakening, her CPAP machine monitor has indicated she is not using it enough, and Medicaid is threatening to refuse to pay for the machine.  She does not have suicidal thoughts.  

The patient also has what she describes as going into a &quot;panic mode.&quot;  During these times, she feels as if her whole body is going to explode.  She has a hard time taking a deep breath, her heart rate goes up, blood pressure is measured as higher shortly afterward, and she gets a sense of impending doom.  These spells may last a couple of hours, but once lasted for about two day.  She does not get chest pain.  These attacks tend to be precipitated by bills that cannot be paid, or being on a &quot;time crunch.&quot; 


PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:
  The patient's nurse practitioner had started her on Cymbalta, up to 60 mg per day. This was helpful, but then another physician switched her to Wellbutrin in the hope that this would help her quit smoking.  Although she was able to cut down on tobacco usage, the depression has been more poorly controlled.  She has used Wellbutrin up to 200 mg b.i.d. and Cymbalta up to 60 mg per day, at different times.  At age 13, the patient cut her wrists because of issues with a boyfriend, and as she was being sutured she realized that this was a very stupid thing to do.  She has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes.  She did see a psychologist at age 16 briefly because of prior issues in her life, but she did not fully reveal information, and it was deemed that she did not need services.  She has not previously spoken with a psychiatrist, but has been seeing a therapist, Stephanie Kitchen, at this facility.


SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:

Caffeine:  The patient has two or three drinks per day of tea or Diet Pepsi.
Tobacco:  She smokes about one pack of cigarettes per week since being on Wellbutrin, and prior to that time had been smoking one-half pack per day.  She is still committed to quitting.
Alcohol: Denied.
Illicit drugs:  Denied.  In her earlier years, someone once put some unknown drug in her milk, and she &quot;came to&quot; when she was dancing on the table in front of the school nurse.


MEDICAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

Constitutional:  See History of Present Illness. No recent fever or sweats.   Neurological:  No history of seizures.  She does have migraine headaches, and has been diagnosed with restless leg syndrome.  When she was small, she twice fell on cinder blocks and struck her head, losing consciousness; she has a facial scar from one of those incidents.  When she was about 3 or 4 years of age, they were playing baseball with a cup being used as a ball, and her brother accidentally hit her in the forehead with a bat; she did not lose consciousness that time.  HEENT:  The patient states she needs glasses, but cannot afford them. Cardiovascular:  Hypertension.  Pulmonary:  Obstructive sleep apnea.  Gastrointestinal:  Recurrent epigastric pain, relieved by Prevacid.  No history of liver disease.  Endocrine and Hematological:  The patient is hypothyroid, has diabetes mellitus, but no hematological disorder.  Dermatological:  Denied.  Musculoskeletal:  Chronic back pain.  The patient has had some nerve ablation, but feels the nerves have been growing back, as the pain has worsened.  She also has right knee pain.  Genitourinary:  Stress incontinence.  Other:  Obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Surgeries:  Bilateral tubal ligation, and partial hysterectomy in 2003 for menorrhagia.  She has had several miscarriages.


ALLERGIES:
  Penicillin and tetanus.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Prescription:  Wellbutrin 200 mg b.i.d., but she has been given a prescription for Cymbalta 30 mg per day, which she was instructed to start within the next few days.  She also takes Ambien (ineffective), L-thyroxin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, Zocor, an unknown medication for restless legs, Ultram, Lidoderm patch, and Zanaflex. She also takes Prevacid.
Over-the-counter:  Multivitamins.
Herbal:  Denied.


DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:
  The patient was born fullterm, vaginally, after a normal pregnancy.  She walked around the furniture at 9 months of age, but did not walk by herself until 14 months of age.


ABUSE HISTORY/TRAUMA/UNUSUAL CHILDHOOD EVENTS: 
  The patient was molested by cousins and by her mother's boyfriends.  Her parents separated when she was 2 years of age, and divorced just before sixth birthday.  Her mother often had parties, and the children were unsupervised.  She was raped at age 15 by a boyfriend.  


FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:
  Her son has ADHD.  Her daughter has depression. Her mother has depression and possibly even bipolar disorder.  Her mother has had substance abuse issues, primarily cannabis and alcohol, but other drugs as well.  Her great grandmother on her father's side has Alzheimer's disease.


FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:
  The patient's mother was adopted, so she only recently learned about family medical history.  An aunt has hypothyroidism, and there is diabetes mellitus on both sides of the family.  There are also individuals with cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, an unknown type of cancer, hypertension, and obesity.  


SOCIAL HISTORY:
  The patient was born in Savannah, Georgia.  She came to Alaska in 2001 because her husband had lost his trucking job (the company filed bankruptcy) and they had become homeless in South Carolina.  Because her mother was residing in Alaska, her husband sent her here, but shortly thereafter they were evicted from that home as well; the building was being sold.  She has a daughter, age 13, and twins (a boy and a girl), age 10.  She has been married for 14 years.  She is presently unemployed, but plans to go on a job interview today with Alaska USA Federal Credit Union.  She is of Pentecostal faith, but only occasionally attends church.  They have had some major difficulties with their church of choice.  At one point, the youth pastor accused her husband of stealing his laptop computer and a credit card; although, it was later found that one of the young people in the church had been the culprit, and no one ever apologized to her husband.  Later on, they were assisting the new youth pastor with a yard sale, and someone stole the proceeds from the sale, as well as some discount cards.  Her husband was again accused, but it was later learned through tracing the discount cards who the thief was.  They feel that the people in the church have viewed them suspiciously, and have not apologized for the false accusations.  


EDUCATIONAL:
  She quit high school twice, the second time being before the last semester of her senior year.  She later earned a GED, after being married.


LEGAL:
  She has never been charged with any crime, but was once accused of carrying a knife that was too long by perhaps a quarter inch.


MENTAL STATUS:
  The patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  She arrived on time.  Grooming is fair to good.  Intelligence is at least average.  She is oriented to time, place and person.  Eye contact is good.  She is able to spell the word &quot;world&quot; in both forward and reverse directions accurately.  Memory is good for immediate recall of three objects, but she recalls only two of the three after a couple of minutes.  She recalls presidents Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Reagan.  Mood is depressed, and affect is consistent with mood.  Speech is highly circumstantial and mildly tangential, but of normal rate and tone.  Insight and judgment are good.  She denies auditory or visual hallucinations.  There is no overt sign of psychosis.  She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.  She interprets the proverb, &quot;People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones&quot; as meaning, &quot;Don't talk about people and you are doing the same thing.&quot;


FORMULATION:
  The patient is a 34-year-old Caucasian female with a long history of depression, with complex nonpsychiatric medical issues.  


DIAGNOSES:


AXIS  I
  296.33 Major depression, recurrent, severe, without psychotic features. 300.21 Rule out panic disorder without agoraphobia.

AXIS  II
  301.9 Personality disorder, not otherwise specified.

AXIS III
  Obesity, diabetes mellitus, stress incontinence, hypercholesterolemia, chronic back and leg pain, epigastric pain, hypothyroidism, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, migraine headaches.

AXIS IV
  Problems related to the primary support group, financial problems, other psychosocial and environmental problems.

AXIS V
    GAF:  48, current.  Highest in past year:  55.


STRENGTHS:
  Normal intelligence, high school equivalency diploma, desire to feel better. 


PROGNOSIS:
  Guarded, due to the patient's rather complex medical issues. With proper treatment, it will be possible to maximize her psychosocial functioning, in spite of her limitations.  Without treatment, her functioning will most likely deteriorate rather substantially and seriously impact her life.


PLAN:
  We discussed in particular the risks and benefits of Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, and some potential medication interactions.  Because the Ambien is ineffective, it should be discontinued.  I have instructed her to decrease Wellbutrin to 200 mg per day for the next week, then discontinue.  She should start Cymbalta 30 mg per day immediately.  

Return to clinic two weeks, at which time we will consider further medication adjustment.  She is to call the clinic nurse in the interim if symptoms warrant.

CHIEF COMPLAINT AND IDENTIFICATION:
  A is a 23-month-old girl, who has a history of reactive airway disease who is being treated on an outpatient basis for pneumonia who presents with cough and fever.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is to known to have reactive airway disease and uses Pulmicort daily and albuterol up to 4 times a day via nebulization.

She has no hospitalizations.

The patient has had a 1 week or so history of cough.  She was seen by the primary care provider and given amoxicillin for yellow nasal discharge according to mom.  She has been taking 1 teaspoon every 6 hours.  She originally was having some low-grade fever with a maximum of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit; however, on the day prior to admission, she had a 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit temperature, and was having posttussive emesis.  She is using her nebulizer, but the child was in respiratory distress, and this was not alleviated by the nebulizer, so she was brought to Children's Hospital Central California.

At Children's Hospital, the patient was originally treated as an asthmatic and was receiving nebulized treatments; however, a chest x-ray did show right-sided pneumonia, and the patient was hypoxemic after resolution of her respiratory distress, so the Hospitalist Service was contacted regarding admission.  The patient was seen and admitted through the emergency room.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 Negative except that indicated in the history of present illness.  All systems were checked.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 As stated in the history of present illness, no hospitalizations, no surgeries.


IMMUNIZATIONS: 
 The patient is up-to-date on her shots.  She has a schedule for her 2-year-old shot soon.


ALLERGIES: 
 No known drug allergies.


DEVELOPMENT HISTORY: 
 Developmentally, she is within normal limits.


FAMILY HISTORY:
  Her maternal uncles have asthma.  There are multiple family members on the maternal side that have diabetes mellitus, otherwise the family history is negative for other chronic medical conditions.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 Her sister has a runny nose, but no other sick contacts.  The family lives in Delano.  She lives with her mom and sister.  The dad is involved, but the parents are separated.  There is no smoking exposure.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  
GENERAL:  The child was in no acute distress.

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 144, respiratory rate 28.  Oxygen saturations 98% on continuous.  Off of oxygen shows 85% laying down on room air.  The T-max in the ER was 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

SKIN:  Clear.

HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, react to light.  No conjunctival injection or discharge.  Tympanic membranes were clear.  No nasal discharge.  Oropharynx moist and clear.

NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or masses.

CHEST:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally; no tachypnea, wheezing, or retractions.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs noted.  Well perfused peripherally.

ABDOMEN:  Bowel sounds are present.  The abdomen is soft.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly, no masses, nontender to palpation.

GENITOURINARY:  No inguinal lymphadenopathy.  Tanner stage I female.

EXTREMITIES:  Symmetric in length.  No joint effusions.  She moves all extremities well.

BACK:  Straight.  No spinous defects.

NEUROLOGIC:  The patient has a normal neurologic exam.  She is sitting up solo in bed, gets on her knees, stands up, is playful, smiles, is interactive.  She has no focal neurologic deficits.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 Chest x-ray by my reading shows a right lower lobe infiltrate.  Metabolic panel:  Sodium 139, potassium 3.5, chloride 106, total CO2 22, BUN and creatinine are 5 and 0.3 respectively, glucose 84, CRP 4.3.  White blood cell count 13.7, hemoglobin and hematocrit 9.6 and 29.9 respectively, and platelets 294,000.  Differential of the white count 34% lymphocytes, 55% neutrophils.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
 This is a 22-month-old girl, who has an infiltrate on the x-ray, hypoxemia, and presented in respiratory distress.  I believe, she has bacterial pneumonia, which is partially treated by her amoxicillin, which is a failure of her outpatient treatment.  She will be placed on the pneumonia pathway and started on cefuroxime to broaden her coverage.  She is being admitted for hypoxemia.  I hope that this will resolve overnight, and she will be discharged in the morning.  I will start her home medications of Pulmicort twice daily and albuterol on a p.r.n. basis; however, at this point, she has no wheezing, so no systemic steroids will be instituted.

Further interventions will depend on the clinical course.

PRE-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
 Superior Gluteal Neuralgia/Neurapraxia-impingement Syndrome.


POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
 Same


PROCEDURE:
 Superior Gluteal Nerve Block, Left.

After verbal informed consent, whereby the patient is made aware of the risks of the procedure, the patient was placed in the standing position with the arms flaccid by the side. Alcohol was used to prep the skin 3 times, and a 27-gauge needle was advanced deep to the attachment of the Gluteus Medius Muscle near its attachment on the PSIS. The needle entered the plane between the Gluteus Medius and Gluteus Maximus Muscle, in close proximity to the Superior Gluteal Nerve. Aspiration was negative, and the mixture was easily injected. Aseptic technique was observed at all times, and there were no complications noted.


INJECTATE INCLUDED:

Methyl Prednisolone (DepoMedrol): 20 mg
Ketorolac (Toradol): 6 mg
Sarapin: 1 cc
Bupivacaine (Marcaine): Q.S.  2 cc.

The procedures, above were performed for diagnostic, as well as therapeutic purposes. This treatment plan is medically necessary to decrease pain and suffering, increase activities of daily living and improve sleep.


ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE&copy; (SDS) RESULTS:
 The patient scored as 'mildly depressed.


NOTE:
 The pain was gone post procedure, consistent with the diagnosis, as well as with adequacy of medication placement.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Basal cell carcinoma (0.8 cm diameter), right medial canthus.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Basal cell carcinoma (0.8 cm diameter), right medial canthus.


OPERATION: 
 Excision basal cell carcinoma (0.8 cm diameter), right medial canthus with frozen section, and reconstruction of defect (1.2 cm diameter) with glabellar rotation flap.


ANESTHESIA:
  Monitored anesthesia care.


JUSTIFICATION: 
 The patient is an 80-year-old white female with a biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma of the right medial canthus.  She was scheduled for elective excision with frozen section under local anesthesia as an outpatient.


PROCEDURE: 
 With an intravenous infusing and under suitable premedication, the patient was placed supine on the operative table.  The face was prepped with pHisoHex draped.  The right medial canthal region and the glabellar region were anesthetized with 1% Xylocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.

Under loupe magnification, the lesion was excised with 2 mm margins, oriented with sutures and submitted for frozen section pathology.  The report was &quot;basal cell carcinoma with all margins free of tumor.&quot;  Hemostasis was controlled with the Bovie.  Excised lesion diameter was 1.2 cm.  The defect was closed by elevating a left laterally based rotation flap utilizing the glabellar skin.  The flap was elevated with a scalpel and Bovie, rotated into the defect without tension, ***** to the defect with scissors and inset in layer with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl for the dermis and running 5-0 Prolene for the skin.  Donor site was closed in V-Y fashion with similar suture technique.

The wounds were dressed with bacitracin ointment.  The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  She tolerated the procedure satisfactorily, and then no complications.  Blood loss was essentially nil.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:

1.  Stage IIIC endometrial cancer.
2.  Adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, Adriamycin, and Abraxane.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a 47-year-old female who was noted to have abnormal vaginal bleeding in the fall of 2009.  In March 2010, she had an abnormal endometrial ultrasound with thickening of the endometrium and an enlarged uterus.  CT scan of the abdomen on 03/22/2010 showed an enlarged uterus, thickening of the endometrium, and a mass structure in the right and left adnexa that was suspicious for ovarian metastasis.  On 04/01/2010, she had a robotic modified radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorotomy and appendectomy with pelvic and periaortic lymphadenectomy.  The pathology was positive for grade III endometrial adenocarcinoma, 9.5 cm in size with 2 cm of invasion.  Four of 30 lymph nodes were positive for disease.  The left ovary was positive for metastatic disease.  Postsurgical PET/CT scan showed left lower pelvic side wall seroma and hypermetabolic abdominal and right pelvic retroperitoneal lymph nodes suspicious for metastatic disease.  The patient has completed five of planned six cycles of chemotherapy and comes in to clinic today for followup.  Of note, we had sent off genetic testing which was denied back in June.  I have been trying to get this testing completed.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
 Synthroid q.d., ferrous sulfate 325 mg b.i.d., multivitamin q.d., Ativan 0.5 mg q.4 hours p.r.n. nausea and insomnia, gabapentin one tablet at bedtime.


ALLERGIES:   
No known drug allergies.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 The patient reports feeling weaker after this last cycle.  She continues to have neuropathy in her feet recorded as a great line neuropathy.  She tried taking two gabapentin for the neuropathy made her nauseous and somnolent.  She does much better with one tablet.  Her family noticed hearing problems.  She was a due to have a hearing test on 08/04/10 but had to reschedule.  She was out of town.  The patient personally does not note problems with her hearing.  She denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  The rest of her review of system is negative.


PHYSICAL EXAM:

VITALS:    BP:  100/56.  HEART RATE:  84.  TEMP:  97.8.  Weight:  75 kg.
GEN:      She has patchy alopecia.
HEENT:    Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Oropharynx is clear.  She has no stomatitis.
NECK:    Supple.  She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.
LUNGS:    Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV:    Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN:    Soft.  He has positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXT:    Lower extremities are without edema.
SKIN:  She has no skin rash.


LABORATORY DATA:  
White blood cell count is 5.3, hemoglobin 11, hematocrit 32.2, and platelets 273,000.  Sodium 137, potassium 3.4, chloride 105, CO2 24, BUN 12, creatinine 0.75, glucose 144, calcium 9.4, total protein 7.5, albumin 3.9, total bilirubin 0.4, alkaline phosphatase 67, AST 33, ALT 23, magnesium 1.9, CEA 1257.


ASSESSMENT/PLAN:   
 This is a very pleasant 47-year-old female with stage IIIC adenocarcinoma of the endometrial cancer.  She has completed five of a planned six cycles of chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cisplatin, and Abraxane.  She is slightly anemic after this last treatment and is feeling weaker.  Most of this is cumulative effects of treatment.  She is experiencing some neuropathy.  With the Abraxane we tend to see more intensive neuropathy during treatment with improved resolution once treatment is completed.  Her chemotherapy toxicities remain minimal.  We will plan to proceed with cycle #6.  I will see her back in the clinic after the sixth cycle.  We will plan to repeat PET/CT scan about a month after she completes her sixth cycle and then she will followup with Dr. X in radiation oncology to further discuss radiation options.

COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
  Nexium 4 mg 4 times per day, Propanolol 10 mg 4 times a day, Spironolactone 100 mg 3 times per day, Lactulose 60 cc's 3 times a day.


GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:  
Mr. Abc, a 54-year-old black married male who was referred for a Comprehensive Clinical Psychological Evaluation as part of a Disability Determination action.  Mr. Abc arrived five minutes late for his scheduled appointment.  He was accompanied to the office by his sister-in-law who drove him to the appt.  Mr. Abc currently does not receive Disability benefits.  This is the first time he has filed for Disability.  The Authorization form listed Mr. Abc's current complaints as &quot;cirrhosis of the liver and mental issues.&quot;  Mr. Abc was well groomed and wore casual attire.  He looked older than his stated age.  The whites of his eyes were very jaundiced.  His posture was slightly stooped and his gait was slow.  He was winded after walking up the stairs.  Psychomotor activity was retarded.  Mr. Abc was cooperative throughout the interview.  Although he appeared to be answering most questions to the best of his ability, he appeared to be minimizing his emotional distress.  


PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 Most information was provided by Mr. Abc who appeared to be a fairly reliable source.  His information was supplemented by review of his medical records.  Mr. Abc has applied for Federal Disability benefits believing that he qualifies based on his cirrhosis of the liver and his cognitive dysfunction.  Mr. Abc was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1991.  His condition has worsened to the point that he is experiencing liver failure and is awaiting a liver transplant.  He stated that his main symptom is extreme fatigue.  He has no energy and is unable to engage in many activities.  Over the past year he was admitted to the hospital four times for confusion and bizarre behavior.  He stated that his sister-in-law and his wife told him that he had become violent and he fought with the Sherriff who was trying to take him to the hospital.  He has no memory of this.  Mr. Abc stated that he was hospitalized one time.  Actually he had begun having problems with confusion in July of 2004 and he has been treated four times since that time.  According to his medical records, he was found wandering outside of his home.  He was apparently delusional believing that a tree branch was a doorknob.  Mr. Abc also suffers from edema and swelling in his legs and his feet.  Mr. Abc attempted to return to work and found that he was unable to do his job due to the necessity of walking one-quarter mile from the front to the back of the plant.  He was unable to walk very far without becoming fatigued.  He had instances where he had passed out after becoming faint.  He had trouble at work sitting for very long because his feet swelled.  He was unable to lift the required 10 pounds of medication boxes.  When he found himself unable to do his regular job, he tried another job at the same plant but was unable to do that job.  He also became confused easily at work.  His doctor advised him to quit and then he did so in March of this year.  In addition to his cognitive symptoms, Mr. Abc has had some disturbance in mood as well.  He related that he feels very sad since he lost his job.  A lot of his self-esteem came from working.  He worries about financial problems.  His sleep has been disturbed.  He sleeps four to five hours a night with trouble falling asleep and frequent awakening in the middle of the night.  His appetite is fair.  


PERSONAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:
  Mr. Abc completed the 11th grade. He went on to get his GED in 1971.  He stated that he has never failed a grade and he has no history of a learning disability.  He received no special education services.  His grades were Bs and Cs. He stated that he was suspended from school one time for fighting but got along well in general. Mr. Abc is currently unemployed.  His last job was at Baxter Health Care where he worked for four years.  It was his longest place of employment.  He quit in March of 2005 because of fatigue and inability to perform the necessary job duties.  He denies that he was ever fired from a job and he reported good work relationships.  Mr. Abc has been married for two years. He has no prior marriages.  He has one daughter age 13.  He currently lives with his wife. Has been at his current address for four years.  


HISTORY OF OTHER PERTINENT MEDICAL EVENTS: 
 Mr. Abc has cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis C, hepatic encephalopathy, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypertension. Surgeries include a cardiac catheterization in 2001, a liver biopsy in 2003.  Over the past year he has been hospitalized four times due to confusion and bizarre behaviors stemming from his liver failure.  


DAILY ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONING:  
Mr. Abc stated that he tries to do things but he has been severely restricted due to his extreme fatigue.  He enjoys reading and does it regularly.  He tries to help his wife with the household chores as he can.  He has washed dishes, cooked, mopped, dusted, vacuumed and has done laundry occasionally over the past month but not as much as he used to.  He stated that he used to mow the yard and do yard work but he can no longer do it because of his extreme fatigue.  He has given up driving all together and he no longer goes out alone.  He spends most days at home.  He enjoys going to church and he prays daily.  


MENTAL HEALTH HISTORY: 
 Mr. Abc has never been diagnosed or treated for a mental health disorder.  He denied any history of mental health problems in his family.  He stated that he was evaluated one time earlier this year by a psychiatrist to determine his suitability for a liver transplant.  He was approved and he is now on the waiting list to receive a liver.  


SUBSTANCE USE HISTORY:  
Mr. Abc has a history of substance use beginning in his teenage years.  He has used alcohol, marijuana and cocaine.  He stated that he only used the marijuana and cocaine a few times when he was young but he continued using alcohol until recently.  His alcohol use became problematic and he was arrested for DWI three times.  He attended AA and the DART program.  Mr. Abc stated that he has been clean for eight years and five months.    


MENTAL STATUS: 
 Mr. Abc was given a four page questionnaire to complete.  He had only been able to complete a few answers after 20 minutes and then was observed letting his sister-in-law fill it out for him.  Mr. Abc was of average height and weight.  He was casually dressed and groomed appropriately.  He was missing a bottom front tooth.  He appeared his stated age.  He was alert and responsive.  He was oriented to time, person, place and situation.  He was cooperative throughout the interview.  Eye contact was good.  Psychomotor activity was retarded.  Affect was constricted.  Mood was sad.  Speech was fluent and goal-directed.  Mr. Abc had a slight slur to his speech which may have been caused by his missing front tooth.  Rates, rhythm and volume were within normal limits although he spoke on the slow side.  Thought processes were coherent but Mr. Abc supplied a paucity of ideas. He seemed to have problems generating details of past events.  His answers were minimal and he used few words.  Thought content focused on feeling bad about his limitations, his illness and losing his job.  He denied any delusional thoughts but apparently he has had some periods of delusional thinking in the past which has been documented in his medical record.  His memory was adequate for recent events.  His memory was impaired for remote events.  Attention and concentration were adequate.  Thinking was very concrete.  Mr. Abc denied any suicidal or homicidal thoughts or plans.  Judgment and insight were adequate.  He reported that his sleep is impaired.  He sleeps four to five hours per night.  Appetite is fair.

Axis II:  None.
Axis III:  Cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis C, hepatic encephalopathy, gastroesophageal reflux disease.


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: 
 Mr. Abc is estimated to be within the average range of intellectual functioning.  He has adequate insight and judgment.  He has filed for Federal Disability benefits, believing that he qualifies for them based on symptoms associated with his cirrhosis of the liver.  He has been experiencing extreme fatigue and has had to limit his activities because of it.  He has swelling in his extremities and is unable to sit for long periods of time.  He is unable to walk for even short distances without tiring.  He has been hospitalized four times over the past year due to cognitive problem, disorientation and bizarre behaviors.  At this time, Mr. Abc is experiencing some mood disturbance.  It appears that this might be secondary to his health problems but given the claimant's tendencies to minimize his mental health symptoms and to fail to give adequate historical details, it is difficult to know for sure.  Based on presentation, intellectually and cognitively, it is believed that Mr. Abc could not complete work-related tasks satisfactorily.  Emotionally and socially, it is believed that he could not tolerate work stressors and could not adjust to a work environment and schedule.  At this time, it is believed that his cognitive dysfunction would be a hindrance to him in a work setting.  


CAPABILITY:
  If Mr. Abc were to receive benefits, it appears that he would not need a payee.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Right mesothelioma.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Right lung mass invading diaphragm and liver.


FINDINGS: 
 Right lower lobe lung mass invading diaphragm and liver.


PROCEDURES:

1.  Right thoracotomy.
2.  Right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and portion of liver.


SPECIMENS: 
 Right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and portion of liver.


BLOOD LOSS: 
 600 mL.


FLUIDS: 
 Crystalloid 2.7 L and 1 unit packed red blood cells.


ANESTHESIA: 
 Double-lumen endotracheal tube.


CONDITION:
  Stable, extubated, to PACU.


PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
  Briefly, this is a gentleman who was diagnosed with a B-cell lymphoma and then subsequently on workup noted to have a right-sided mass seeming to arise from the right diaphragm.  He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma.  Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure.  He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.

An epidural catheter was placed.  He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed.  He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.

A low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered.  Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected.  It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm.  He also had some marked lymphadenopathy.  With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection.  Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly.  We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe.  The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties.  Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment.  This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk.  This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe.  This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated.  Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.

We then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein.  The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well.  The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie.  Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures.  The bronchial anatomy was defined.  Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe.  A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed.  The lung insufflated.  The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well.  The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.

We then turned our attention to the diaphragm.  There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin.  Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved.  It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion.  The Bovie was set to high cautery.  The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver.  It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver.  Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure.  The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent.  The area was inspected for hemostasis.  A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension.  A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed.  The lung was seen to expand.  We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe.  Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case.  The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump.  The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs.  The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin.  The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.

Dr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver.

REASON FOR CONSULT:
  Depression.


HPI:
  The patient is an 87-year-old white female admitted for low back pain status post hip fracture sustained a few days before Thanksgiving in 2006.  The patient was diagnosed and treated for a T9 compression fraction with vertebroplasty.  Soon after discharge, the patient was readmitted with severe mid low back pain and found to have a T8 compression fracture.  This was also treated with vertebroplasty.  The patient is now complaining of back pain that fluctuates at time, acknowledging her pain medication works but not all the time.  Her pain is in her upper back around her shoulder blades.  The patient says lying down with the heated pad lessens the pain and that any physical activity increases it.  MRI on January 29, 2007, was positive for possible meningioma to the left of anterior box.

The patient reports of many depressive symptoms, has lost all interest in things she used to do (playing cards, reading).  Has no energy to do things she likes, but does participate in physical therapy, cries often and what she believes for no reason.  Does not see any future for herself.  Reports not being able to concentrate on anything saying she gets distracted by thoughts of how she does not want to live anymore.  Admits to decreased appetite, feeling depressed, and always wanting to be alone.  Claims that before her initial hospitalization for her hip fracture, she was highly active, enjoyed living independently at Terrace.  Denies suicidal ideations and homicidal ideations, but that she did not mind dying, and denies any manic symptoms including decreased need to sleep, inflated self-worth, and impulsivity.  Denies auditory and visual hallucinations.  No paranoid, delusions, or other abnormalities of thought content.  Denies panic attacks, flashbacks, and other feelings of anxiety.

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Cervical dystonia.
2.  Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome.

Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side.  She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago.  She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone.  The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  The patient is appropriate.  She is well dressed and oriented x3.  She still smells of some cigarette smoke.  Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles.  There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved.  On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding.  This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved.


TREATMENT PLAN:
  After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles.  A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated.  The procedure is being scheduled.  The patient's medications are refilled.  She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  In 2002, the patient had a blood test during her routine screening, which revealed anemia and an elevated creatinine.  Two weeks later she saw a nephrologist at ABCDE were she worked at that time.  An ultrasound revealed that she had Parenchymal disease in which tissue around the kidney is diseased.  No particular treatment was advised.  She was laid off 6 months later.  In 2004, she began working at The ABCD Hospital and began seeing Dr. A.  She was put on Procrit, but could not keep the stringent appointment scheduled for the injection because of her work.  She began seeing Dr. B and was put on Procrit and Renagel.  She was advised to go on dialysis, but she felt she did not have enough information to such a drastic step.  She saw an endocrinologist for some thyroid problem and her blood work showed that her creatinine was now at 7.  She was referred to Dr. Xyz who found after a parathyroid scan that she may have an adenoma.  Her creatinine is now 7.4.

PROCEDURE:  
Transforaminal Epidural, lumbar.


INFORMED CONSENT: 
 The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.

The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.
The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.


PROCEDURE: 
 Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.

The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the lower abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the facet joints and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1 % lidocaine.

With fluoroscopy, a *** spinal needle was gently guided into the superior-anterior neuroforamin lateral to the mid-pedicular line at ***.  Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.  Approximately *** of non-ionic contrast agent was injected into the joint under real time fluoroscopic observation.  Correct needle placement was confirmed by production of an appropriate epidurogram and radiculogram without concurrent vascular dye pattern.  Finally the treatment solution, consisting of *** was injected.

All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile techniques were used throughout the procedure.


COMPLICATIONS:  
None.  No complications.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition.


DISCUSSION: 
 Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.

The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.

Follow up appointment was made in approximately 1 week.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:

1.  Leiomyosarcoma.
2.  History of pulmonary embolism.
3.  History of subdural hematoma.
4.  Pancytopenia.
5.  History of pneumonia.


PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:

1.  Cycle six of CIVI-CAD (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC) from 07/22/2008 to 07/29/2008.
2.  CTA, chest PE study showing no evidence for pulmonary embolism.
3.  Head CT showing no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
4.  Sinus CT, normal mini-CT of the paranasal sinuses.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
Ms. ABC is a pleasant 66-year-old Caucasian female who first palpated a mass in the left posterior arm in spring of 2007.  The mass increased in size and she was seen by her primary care physician and referred to orthopedic surgeon.  MRI showed inflammation and was thought to be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.  The mass increased in size.  She eventually underwent a partial resection found to have pathologic grade 2 leiomyosarcoma, margins were impossible to assess, but were likely positive.  She was evaluated by Dr. X and Dr. Y and a decision was made to proceed with preoperative chemotherapy.  She began treatment with CIVI-CAD in December 2007.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and subdural hematoma while on anticoagulation.  She eventually underwent surgical resection on May 1, 2008 with small area of residual disease, but otherwise clear margins.


HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Leiomyosarcoma, the patient was admitted to Hem/Onco B Service under attending Dr. XYZ for cycle six of continuous IV infusion Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC, which she tolerated well.
2.  History of pulmonary embolism.  Upon admission, the patient reported an approximate two-week history of dyspnea on exertion and some mild chest pain.  She underwent a CTA, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and the patient was started on prophylactic doses of Lovenox at 40 mg a day.  She had no further complaints throughout the hospitalization with any shortness of breath or chest pain.
3.  History of subdural hematoma, also on admission the patient noted some mild intermittent headaches that were fleeting in nature, several a day that would resolve on their own.  Her headaches were not responding to pain medication and so on 07/24/2008, we obtained a head CT that showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.  The patient also had a history of sinusitis and so a sinus CT scan was obtained, which was normal.
4.  Pancytopenia.  On admission, the patient's white blood count was 3.4, hemoglobin 11.3, platelet count 82, and ANC of 2400.  The patient's counts were followed throughout admission.  She did not require transfusion of red blood cells or platelets; however, on 07/26/2008 her ANC did dip to 900 and she was placed on neutropenic diet.  At discharge her ANC is back up to 1100 and she is taken off neutropenic diet.  Her white blood cell count at discharge was 1.4 and her hemoglobin was 11.2 with a platelet count of 140.
5.  History of pneumonia.  During admission, the patient did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of pneumonia.


DISPOSITION: 
 Home in stable condition.


DIET: 
 Regular and less neutropenic.


ACTIVITY: 
 Resume same activity.


FOLLOWUP:  
The patient will have lab work at Dr. XYZ on 08/05/2008 and she will also return to the cancer center on 08/12/2008 at 10:20 a.m.  The patient is also advised to monitor for any fevers greater than 100.5 and should she have any further problems in the meantime to please call in to be seen sooner.

DIAGNOSIS: 
 Left breast adenocarcinoma stage T3 N1b M0, stage IIIA.

She has been found more recently to have stage IV disease with metastatic deposits and recurrence involving the chest wall and lower left neck lymph nodes.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS

1.  Glucosamine complex.
2.  Toprol XL.
3.  Alprazolam
4.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
5.  Dyazide.
6.  Centrum.

Dr. X has given her some carboplatin and Taxol more recently and feels that she would benefit from electron beam radiotherapy to the left chest wall as well as the neck.  She previously received a total of 46.8 Gy in 26 fractions of external beam radiotherapy to the left supraclavicular area.  As such, I feel that we could safely re-treat the lower neck.  Her weight has increased to 189.5 from 185.2.  She does complain of some coughing and fatigue.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

NECK:  On physical examination palpable lymphadenopathy is present in the left lower neck and supraclavicular area.  No other cervical lymphadenopathy or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is present.
RESPIRATORY:  Good air entry bilaterally. Examination of the chest wall reveals a small lesion where the chest wall recurrence was resected.  No lumps, bumps or evidence of disease involving the right breast is present.
ABDOMEN:  Normal bowel sounds, no hepatomegaly.  No tenderness on deep palpation. She has just started her last cycle of chemotherapy today, and she wishes to visit her daughter in Brooklyn, New York. After this she will return in approximately 3 to 4 weeks and begin her radiotherapy treatment at that time.

I look forward to keeping you informed of her progress.  Thank you for having allowed me to participate in her care.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Squamous cell carcinoma of the scalp.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Same.


OPERATION PERFORMED: 
 Radical resection of tumor of the scalp (CPT 11643).  Excision of tumor from the skull with debridement of the superficial cortex with diamond bur.  Advancement flap closure, with total undermined area 18 centimeters by 16 centimeters (CPT 14300).


ANESTHESIA:
  General endotracheal anesthesia.


INDICATIONS:  
This is an 81-year-old male who has a large exophytic 7cm lesion of the anterior midline scalp which is biopsy-positive for skin malignancy, specifically, squamous call carcinoma.  This appears to be affixed to the underlying scalp.


PLAN: 
 Radical resection with frozen sections to clear margins thereafter, with planned reconstruction.


CONSENT:
  I have discussed with the patient the possible risks of bleeding, infection, renal problems, scar formation, injury to muscle, nerves, and possible need for additional surgery with possible recurrence of the patient's carcinoma, with review of detailed informed consent with the patient, who understood, and wished to proceed.


FINDINGS: 
 The patient had a 7cm large exophytic lesion which appeared to be invasive into the superficial table of the skull.  The final periosteal margin which centrally appeared was positive for carcinoma.  The final margins peripherally were all negative.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: 
 The patient was taken to the operating room and there was placed supine on the operating room table.

General endotracheal anesthesia was administered after endotracheal tube intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Service personnel.  The patient was thereafter prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using Betadine Scrub and Betadine paint.  Thereafter, the local anesthesia was injected into the area around the tumor.  A **** type excision was planned down to the periosteum.  A supraperiosteal radical resection was performed.

It was obvious that there was tumor at the deep margin, involving the periosteum.  The edges were marked along the four quadrants, at the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, and the 9 o'clock positions, and these were sent for frozen section evaluation.  Frozen section revealed positive margins at one end of the resection.  Therefore, an additional circumferential resection was performed and the final margins were all negative.
Following completion, the deep periosteal margin was resected.  The circumferential periosteal margins were noted to be negative; however, centrally, there was a small area which showed tumor eroding into the superficial cortex of the skull.  Therefore, the Midas Rex drill was utilized to resect approximately 1-2 mm of the superficial cortex of the bone at the area where the positive margin was located.  Healthy bone was obtained; however, it did not enter the diploic or marrow-containing bone in the area.  Therefore, no bong margin was taken.  However, at the end of the procedure, it did not appear that the residual bone had any residual changes consistent with carcinoma.

Following completion of the bony resection, the area was irrigated with copious amounts of saline.  Thereafter, advancement flaps were created, both on the left and the right side of the scalp, with the total undermined area being approximately 18cm by 16cm.  The galea was incised in multiple areas, to provide for additional mobilization of the tissue.  The tissue was closed under tension with 3-0 Vicryl suture deep in the galea and surgical staples superficially.

The patient was awakened from anesthetic, was extubated and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.


DISPOSITION:
  The patient was discharged to home with antibiotics and analgesics, to follow-up in approximately one week.


NOTE: 
 The final margins of both periosteal, as well as skin were negative circumferentially, around the tumor.  The only positive margin was deep, which was a periosteal margin and bone underlying it was partially resected, as was indicated above.

2.  Epidural fibrosis with nerve root entrapment.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  

1.  Right lower extremity radiculopathy with history of post laminectomy pain.
2.  Epidural fibrosis with nerve root entrapment.


OPERATION PERFORMED: 
 Right L4, attempted L5, and S1 transforaminal epidurogram for neural mapping.


ANESTHESIA:
  Local/IV sedation.


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


SUMMARY: 
 The patient in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Local anesthetic was used to insufflate the skin and paraspinal tissues and the L5 disk level on the right was noted to be completely collapsed with no way whatsoever to get a needle to the neural foramen of the L5 root.  The left side was quite open; however, that was not the side of her problem.  At this point using a oblique fluoroscopic projection and gun-barrel technique, a 22-gauge 3.5 inch spinal needle was placed at the superior articular process of L5 on the right, stepped off laterally and redirected medially into the intervertebral foramen to the L4 nerve root.  A second needle was taken and placed at the S1 nerve foramen using AP and lateral fluoroscopic views to confirm location.  After negative aspiration, 2 cc of Omnipaque 240 dye was injected through each needle.

There was a defect flowing in the medial epidural space at both sides.  There were no complications.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Mass, left second toe.
2.  Tumor.
3.  Left hallux bone invasion of the distal phalanx.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Mass, left second toe.
2.  Tumor.
3.  Left hallux with bone invasion of the distal phalanx.


PROCEDURE PERFORMED:

1.  Excision of mass, left second toe.
2.  Distal Syme's amputation, left hallux with excisional biopsy.


HISTORY: 
 This 47-year-old Caucasian male presents to ABCD General Hospital with a history of tissue mass on his left foot.  The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size.  The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past.  The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.


PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
  An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap.  Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.

The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses.  The foot was lowered to the operating table.  The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge.  A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux.  The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone.  The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx.  There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx.  The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer.  Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen.  At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx.  The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues.  Any suspicious tissue was removed.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.

Attention was then directed to the left second toe.  There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe.  A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass.  The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule.  This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance.  It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact.  The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed.  The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology.  Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC.

PROCEDURES:

1.  Placement of SynchroMed infusion pump.
2.  Tunneling of SynchroMed infusion pump catheter
3.  Anchoring of the intrathecal catheter and connecting of the right lower quadrant SynchroMed pump catheter to the intrathecal catheter.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
 Under general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position.  The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The intrathecal catheter was placed via a percutaneous approach by the pain management specialist at which point an incision was made adjacent to the needle containing the intrathecal catheter.  This incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the paraspinous muscle fascia which was cleared around the entry point of the intrathecal catheter needle.  A pursestring suture of 3-0 Prolene was placed around the needle in the paraspinous muscle.  The needle was withdrawn.  The pursestring suture was tied to snug the tissues around the catheter and prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.  The catheter demonstrated free flow of cerebrospinal fluid
throughout the RV procedure.  The catheter was anchored to the paraspinous muscle with an anchoring device using interrupted sutures of 3-0 Prolene.  Antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic soak sponge were placed into the wound, and the catheter was clamped to prevent persistent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid while the SynchroMed-pump pocket was created.  Then, I turned my attention to the anterior abdominal wall where an oblique incision was made and carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which was freed from attachments to the overlying subcutaneous tissue utilizing blunt and sharp dissection with electrocautery.  A pocket was created that would encompass the SynchroMed fusion pump.  A tunneling device was then passed through the subcutaneous tissue from the back incision to the abdominal incision, and a SynchroMed pump catheter was placed to the tunneling device.  The tunneling device was then removed leaving the SynchroMed pump catheter extending from the anterior abdominal wall incision to the posterior back incision.  The intrathecal catheter was trimmed.  A clear plastic boot was placed over the intrathecal catheter, and the connecting device was advanced from the SynchroMed pump catheter into the intrathecal catheter connecting the 2 catheters together.  The clear plastic boot was then placed over the connection, and it was anchored in place with 0-silk ties.  Good CSF was then demonstrated flowing through the SynchroMed pump catheter.  The SynchroMed pump catheter was connected to the SynchroMed pump and anchored in place with a 0-silk tie.  Excess catheter was coiled and placed behind the pump.  The pump was placed into the subcutaneous pocket created for it on the anterior abdominal wall.  The pump was anchored to the anterior abdominal wall fascia with interrupted sutures of 2-0 Prolene; 4 of the sutures were placed.  The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with normal saline.  The subcutaneous tissue of both wounds was closed with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin of both wounds was closed with staples.  Antibiotic ointment and a sterile dressing were applied.  The patient was awake and taken to the recovery room.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable at the completion of the procedure.  All sponge and lap, needle and instrument counts were correct at the completion of the procedure.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
  Newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a 47-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain in September 2006.  On chest x-ray, she had a possible infiltrate and it was thought she might have pneumonia and she was treated with antibiotics and prednisone.  Symptoms improved temporarily, but did not completely resolve.  By the end of September, her pain had worsened and she was seen in the emergency room at ABC.  Chest x-ray was compatible with pleurisy and she was treated with Percocet.  Few days later, she was seen and given a prescription for Ultram because Percocet was causing nausea.  Eventually, she was seen by Dr. X and noted to have splenomegaly.  Repeat ultrasound was done and showed the spleen enlarged at 19 cm.  In retrospect, this was not changed in comparison to an ultrasound that was done in September.  She underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, which showed diffuse hypermetabolic lymph nodes measuring 1 to 2 cm in diameter, as well as a hypermetabolic spleen that was enlarged.

The patient underwent lymph node biopsy on the right neck on 10/27/2006.  Pathology is consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.

On 10/31/2006, she had a bone marrow biopsy.  This does show involvement of bone marrow with lymphoma.

She was noted to have circulating lymphoma cells on peripheral smear as well.

Although CBC was normal, MCV was low and the ferritin was assessed and was low at 8, consistent with iron deficiency.


ALLERGIES:
  NONE.


MEDICATIONS:  

1.  Estradiol/Prometrium.  
2.  Ultram p.r.n.  
3.  Baby aspirin.  
4.  Lunesta for sleep.  
5.  She has been started on iron supplements.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  

1.  Tubal ligation in 1986.
2.  Possible cyst removed from the left neck in 1991.
3.  Tonsillectomy.
4.  Migraines, which are rare.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 She does not smoke cigarettes and drinks alcohol only occasionally.  She is married and has two children, ages 24 and 20.  She works as a project administrator.


FAMILY HISTORY:  
Father is deceased.  He had emphysema and colon cancer at age 68.  Mother has arrhythmia and hypertension.  Her sister has hypertension and her brother is healthy.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  

GENERAL:  She is in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Her weight is 168 pounds, and she is afebrile with a normal blood pressure and pulse.

NECK:  There is shotty adenopathy in the neck.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate without murmur.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender and shows the spleen palpable about 10 cm below the right costal margin.
EXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema is noted.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 CBC and chemistry panel are pending.  CBC was normal last week.  PT/INR was normal as well.


IMPRESSION:
  Newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma, admitted now to start chemotherapy.  She will start treatment with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone.  Toxicities have already been discussed with her including myelosuppression, mucositis, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, the low risk for cardiac toxicity, bladder toxicity, neuropathy, constipation, etc.  Written materials were provided to her last week.


PLAN: 
 Plan will be to add Rituxan a little later in her course because she has circulating lymphoma cells.  She will be started on allopurinol today as well as hydration further to avoid the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome.

Plan will be to have her evaluated for bone marrow transplant in first remission.  I will have Dr. Y see her while she is in the hospital.

The patient is anxious, and will be given Ativan as needed.  We will discontinue aspirin for now, but continue estradiol/Prometrium.

Iron deficiency will be treated with oral iron supplements and we will follow her counts.  She may well have gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, which is not uncommon with mantle cell lymphoma.  After she undergoes remission, we will consider colonoscopy for biopsies prior to proceeding to transplant.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Right pleural effusion and suspected malignant mesothelioma.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Right pleural effusion, suspected malignant mesothelioma.


PROCEDURE: 
 Right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy.


ANESTHESIA:
  General double-lumen endotracheal.


DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS: 
 Right pleural effusion, firm nodules, diffuse scattered throughout the right pleura and diaphragmatic surface.


SPECIMEN: 
 Pleural biopsies for pathology and microbiology.


ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
 Minimal.


FLUIDS: 
 Crystalloid 1.2 L and 1.9 L of pleural effusion drained.


INDICATIONS: 
 Briefly, this is a 66-year-old gentleman who has been transferred from an outside hospital after a pleural effusion had been drained and biopsies taken from the right chest that were thought to be consistent with mesothelioma.  Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.


PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position.  A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed.  SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol.  The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion.  At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery.  The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site.  Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules.  An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion.  The effusion was then drained with a sucker.  Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura.  Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease.  This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization.  After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc.  The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well.  A 32 curved chest tube chest tube was placed and secured with nylon.  The other port site was closed at the level of the fascia with 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for the skin.  The patient was then brought in the supine position and extubated and brought to recovery room in stable condition.

Dr. X was present for the entire procedure which was right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsies.

The counts were correct x2 at the end of the case.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
  Stage IIA right breast cancer.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
This is an extremely pleasant 58-year-old woman, who I am following for her stage IIA right breast cancer.  She noticed a lump in the breast in November of 2007.  A mammogram was obtained dated 01/28/08, which showed a mass in the right breast.  On 02/10/08, she underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy.  The pathology showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma Nottingham grade II.  The tumor was ER positive, PR positive and HER-2/neu negative.  On 02/22/08, she underwent a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.  The pathology showed a 3.3 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade I, one sentinel lymph node was negative.  Therefore it was a T2, N0, M0 stage IIA breast cancer.  Of note, at that time she was taking hormone replacement therapy and that was stopped.  She underwent radiation treatment ending in May 2008.  She then started on Arimidex, but unfortunately she did not tolerate the Arimidex and I changed her to Femara.  She also did not tolerate the Femara and I changed it to tamoxifen.  She did not tolerate the tamoxifen and therefore when I saw her on 11/23/09, she decided that she would take no further antiestrogen therapy.  She met with me again on 02/22/10, and decided she wants to rechallenge herself with tamoxifen.  When I saw her on 04/28/10, she was really doing quite well with tamoxifen.  She tells me 2 weeks after that visit, she developed toxicity from the tamoxifen and therefore stopped it herself.  She is not going take to any further tamoxifen.

Overall, she is feeling well.  She has a good energy level and her ECOG performance status is 0.  She denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.  No lymphadenopathy.  No nausea or vomiting.  No change in bowel or bladder habits.

HISTORY:
  The patient is 14 months old, comes in with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing.  Difficulty breathing began last night.  He was taken to Emergency Department where he got some Xopenex, given a prescription for amoxicillin and discharged home.  They were home for about an hour when he began to get worse and they drove here to Children's Hospital.  He has a history of reactive airway disease.  He has been seen here twice in the last month on 10/04/2007 and 10/20/2007, both times with some wheezing.  He was diagnosed with pneumonia back on 06/12/2007 here in the Emergency Department but was not admitted at that time.  He has been on albuterol off and on over that period.  He has had fever overnight.  No vomiting, no diarrhea.  Increased work of breathing with retractions and audible wheezes noted and thus brought to the Emergency Department.  Normal urine output.  No rashes have been seen.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 As noted above.  No hospitalizations, surgeries, allergies.


MEDICATIONS: 
 Xopenex.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 Ten are asked, all are negative, except as noted above.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

VITAL SIGNS:  Temp 37.1, pulse 158, respiratory rate 48, 84% on room air indicating hypoxia.
GENERAL:  The child is awake, alert, in moderate respiratory distress.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  The TMs are clear.  The nares show some dry secretions.  Audible congestion and wheezing is noted.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Throat is clear.  No oral lesions noted.
NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.
LUNGS:  Show inspiratory and expiratory wheezes in all fields.  Audible wheezes are noted.  There are intercostal and subcostal retractions and suprasternal muscle use is noted.
HEART:  Shows tachycardia.  Regular rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding.  No rebound.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Capillary refill is brisk.  Good distal pulses.
NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Moves all 4 extremities equally and normally.


HOSPITAL COURSE: 
 The child has an IV placed.  I felt the child was dehydrated on examination.  We gave 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline over one hour.  The child was given Solu-Medrol 2 mg/kg IV.  He was initially started on unit dose albuterol and Atrovent but high-dose albuterol for continuous nebulization was ordered.

A portable chest x-ray was done showing significant peribronchial thickening bilaterally.  Normal heart size.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No evidence of focal pneumonia.  After 3 unit dose of albuterol/Atrovent breathing treatments, there was much better air exchange bilaterally but still with inspiratory/expiratory wheezes and high-dose continuous albuterol was started at that time.  The child was monitored closely while on high-dose albuterol and slowly showed improvement resulting in only expiratory wheezes after one hour.  The child's pulse ox on breathing treatments with 100% oxygen was 100%.  Respiratory rate remained about 40 to 44 breaths per minute indicating tachypnea.  The child's color improved with oxygen therapy, and the capillary refill was always less than 2 seconds.

The child has failed outpatient therapy at this time.  After 90 minutes of continuous albuterol treatment, the child still has expiratory wheezes throughout.  After I removed the oxygen, the pulse ox was down at 91% indicating hypoxia.  The child has a normal level of alertness; however, has not had any vomiting here.  I spoke with Dr. X, on call for hospitalist service.  She has come down and evaluated the patient.  We both feel that since this child had two ER visits this last month, one previous ER visit within the last 5 hours, we should admit the child for continued albuterol treatments, IV steroids, and asthma teaching for the family.  The child is admitted in a stable condition.


DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES:  
Ruled out pneumothorax, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup.


TIME SPENT:  
Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.

CC: 
 &quot;Five years ago, I stopped drinking and since that time, I have had severe depression.  I was doing okay when I stopped my medications in April for a few weeks, but then I got depressed again.  I started lithium three weeks ago.&quot;


HPI:  
The patient is a 45-year-old married white female without children currently working as a billing analyst for Northwest Natural.  The patient has had one psychiatric hospitalization for seven days in April of 1999.  The patient now presents with recurrent depressive symptoms for approximately four months.  The patient states that she has decreased energy, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, feelings of guilt, feelings of extreme anger, psychomotor agitation, and increased appetite.  The patient states her sleep is normal and her ability to concentrate is normal.  The patient states that last night she had an argument with her husband in which he threaten to divorce her.  The patient went into the rest room, tried to find a razor blade, could not find one but instead found a scissor and cut her arm moderately with some moderate depth.  She felt better after doing so and put a bandage over the wound and did not report to her husband or anybody else what she had done.  The patient reports that she has had increased tension with her husband as of recent.  She notes that approximately a week ago she struck her husband several times.  She states that he has never hit her but instead pushed her back after she was hitting him.  She reports no history of abuse in the past.  The patient identifies recent stressors as having ongoing conflict at work with her administrator with them &quot;cracking down on me.&quot; The patient also notes that her longstanding therapy will be temporarily interrupted by the therapist having a child.  She states that her recent depression seems to coincide with her growing knowledge that her therapist was pregnant.  The patient states that she has a tremendous amount of anger towards her therapist for discontinuing or postponing treatment.  She states that she feels &quot;abandoned.&quot; The patient notes that it does raise issues with her past, where she had a child at the age of 17 who she gave away for adoption and a second child that she was pregnant by the age of 42 that she aborted at the request of her husband.  The patient states she saw her therapist most recently last Friday.  She sees the therapy weekly and indicates the therapy helps, although she is unable to specify how.  When asked for specifics of what she has learned from the therapy, the patient was unable to reply.  It appears that she is very concrete and has difficulty with symbolization and abstractions and self-observation.  The patient reports that at her last visit her therapist was concerned that she may be suicidal and was considering hospitalization.  The patient, at that point, stated that she would be safe through Monday despite having made a gesture last night.  At present, the patient's mood is reactive and for much of the session she appears angry and irritated with me but at the end of the session, after I have given her my assessment, she appears calmed and not depressed.  When asked if she is suicidal at present, she states no.  The patient does not want to go into the hospital.  The patient also indicates at the end of the session she felt hopeful.  The patient reports her current sleep is about eight hours per night.  She states that longest she has been able to stay awake in the past has been 24 hours.  She states that during periods where she feels up she sleeps perhaps six hours per night.  The patient reports no spending sprees and no reports no sexual indiscretions.  The patient states that her sexuality does increase when she is feeling better but not enormously so.  The patient denies any history of delusions or hallucinations.  The patient denies any psychosis.  The patient states that she does have mood swings and that the upstate lasts for a couple of weeks at longest.  She states that more predominately she has depression.  The patient states that she does not engage in numerous projects when she is in an upstate although does imagine doing so.  The patient notes that suicidality and depression seems to often arise around disputes with her husband and/or feelings of abandonment.  The patient indicates some satisfaction when she is called on her behavior &quot;I need to answer for my actions.&quot; The patient gives a substantial history of alcohol abuse lasting up to about five years ago when she was hospitalized.  Most typically, the patient will drink at least a bottle of wine per day.  The patient has attended AA but at present going once a week, although she states that she is not engaged as she has been in the past; and when asked if she may be in early relapse, she indicates that yes that is a very real possibility.  The patient states she is not working through any of the steps at present.


PPH: 
 The patient denies any sexual abuse as a child.  She states that she was disciplined primarily by her father with spankings.  She states that on occasion her mother would use a belt to spank her or with her hand or with a spoon.  The patient has been seeing Dr. A for the past five years.  Prior to that she was admitted to a hospital for her suicide attempt.  The patient also has one short treatment experienced with the Day Treatment Program here in Portland.  The patient states that it was not useful as it focused on group work with pts that she did not feel any similarity with.  The patient, also as a child, had a history of cutting behaviors.  The patient was admitted to the hospital after lacerating her arm.


MEDICAL HISTORY:  
The patient has hypothyroidism and last had her TSH drawn a week ago but does not know the results.  Janet Green is her primary physician.  The patient also has had herniated disc in the neck and a sinus inflammation, both of which were treated surgically.

SUBSTANCE HISTORY: 
 The patient has been sober for five years.  She drank one bottle of wine per day as per HPI.  History of drinking for approximately 25 years.  The patient does not currently have a sponsor.  The patient experimented with amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana approximately 16 years ago.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 The patient's mother is age 66, father is age 70, and she has a brother age 44.  Her brother has been incarcerated numerous times for assaults and has difficulty with anger and rage.  He made a suicide attempt at age 17.  The patient's father is a machinist who she describes as somewhat narcissistic and with alcohol abuse problem.  He also has arthritis.  The patient's mother is arthritic.  She states that her mother stopped working at middle age after being laid off and appears somewhat reclusive.


EDUCATIONAL HISTORY: 
 The patient was educated through high school and has two years of Night College.  The patient states that she grew up and was raised in Portland but notes her childhood was primarily lonely.  She states she was unliked and unpopular child because she was &quot;shy&quot; and &quot;not smart enough.&quot; The patient denies having secrets.  The patient reports that this is her second marriage, which has lasted two years.  Her first marriage lasted I believe it was five years.  The patient also had a relationship in recovery for four years, which ended after they went &quot;different directions.&quot;


MSE:
  The patient is middle-aged white female, dressed in a red sweater with a white shirt, full patterned skirt, and open sandals.  The patient is suspicious and somewhat confrontative early in the session.  She asked me regarding my cancellation policy, why I require seven days and not 24 hours.

Regarding plan, the patient notes that cutting herself hurts too much therefore she would like to take some benzodiazepines or barbiturates but has access to none.  The patient states that she will not try to hurt herself currently and that she poses no risk at present.  The patient notes that she does not want to go to the hospital at present.  The patient is alert and oriented x 3.  Recall is three for three at five minutes.  Proverbs are concrete.  She has fair impulse control, poor judgment, and poor insight.


FORMULATION:  
The patient is a 45-year-old married white female with no children now presenting with recurrent depressive symptoms and active suicidal ideation and planning.  The patient reports longstanding depressive symptoms that were subthreshold punctuated by periods of more severe depression.  The patient also reports some up periods, which do not meet most criteria for a bipolar disorder or manic states.  The patient notes that current depression started with approximately the same time that she became aware that her therapist was pregnant.  She notes that the current depression is atypical in that it is primarily anger based and she does not have the typical hypersomnia that she gets.  The patient reports being unable to express anger to her therapist and being unable to discuss her feeling regarding the pregnancy.  The patient also states that she feels abandoned with the upcoming discontinuation of treatment while the therapist is giving birth and thereafter.  Symptoms are consistent with a longstanding dysthymia and reoccurring depression.  In addition, diagnosis is highly complicated by presence of a strong personality disorder component, most likely borderline personality disorder.  This latter diagnosis seems to be the most active at this time with the patient acutely reacting to perceived therapist's absence and departure.  This is exacerbated by instability in the patient's marital life.


DIAGNOSIS:

Axis I:  Dysthymia.  Major depression, moderate severity, recurrent, with partial remission.
Axis II:  Borderline personality disorder.
Axis III:  Hypothyroidism and cervical disc herniation and sinus surgery.
Axis IV:  Medical access.  Marital discord.
Axis V:  A GAF of 30.


PLAN:  
The patient is unlikely to have bipolar disorder.  We will recommend the patient's thyroid be rechecked to ensure she is currently euthymic.  We would recommend continued weekly or twice weekly insight oriented psychotherapy with aggressive exploration of the patient's reaction to her therapist's departure.  We would also recommend dialectical behavioral therapy while the therapist is on leave.  We would recommend continued treatment with SSRIs for dysthymia and depression.  We would suggest prescribing long acting antidepressant such as Prozac, given the patient's ambivalence regarding medications.  Prozac should be pushed to minimum of 40 mg, which the patient has already tolerated in the past, but most likely up to 60 or 80 mg.  We might also supplement the Prozac with a (anti-sleep medication).

Time spent with the patient was 1.5 hours.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
 New-onset seizure.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.  Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted.  There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces.  She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 
 She has undergone no surgical procedures.


FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt.  There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings.  She is at home full time and does not attend day care.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

Vital Signs:  Weight was 15.6 kg.  She was afebrile.  Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record.
General:  She was awake, alert, and oriented.  She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads.
HEENT:  Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head.  Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear.  Her eye movements were conjugate in nature.  Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist.
Neck:  Trachea appeared to be in the midline.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Cardiovascular:  Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur.
Abdomen:  Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination.
Extremities:  Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV.  There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout.  She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs.
Neurological:  From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout.  Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation.  Her overall resting tone was normal.  Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities.  Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella.  Toes were downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements.  Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement.


ASSESSMENT:
  A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures.


RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications.
2.  As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day.  If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.
3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.  The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient.
4.  The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Lumbar osteomyelitis.
2.  Need for durable central intravenous access.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Lumbar osteomyelitis.
2.  Need for durable central intravenous access.


ANESTHESIA:
  General.


PROCEDURE:
  Placement of left subclavian 4-French Broviac catheter.


INDICATIONS:  
The patient is a toddler admitted with a limp and back pain, who was eventually found on bone scan and septic workup to have probable osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine at disk areas.  The patient needs prolonged IV antibiotic therapy, but attempt at a PICC line failed.  She has exhausted most of her easy peripheral IV access routes and referral was made to the Pediatric Surgery Service for Broviac placement.  I met with the patient's mom.  With the help of a Spanish interpreter, I explained the technique for Broviac placement.  We discussed the surgical risks and alternatives, most of which have been exhausted.  All their questions have been answered, and the patient is fit for operation today.


DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  
The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia.  We conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of the patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were here to place the Broviac catheter.  Preparation and draping of her skin was performed with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then an infraclavicular approach to left subclavian vein was performed.  A flexible guidewire was inserted into the central location and then a 4-French Broviac catheter was tunneled through the subcutaneous tissues and exiting on the right anterolateral chest wall well below and lateral to the breast and pectoralis major margins.  The catheter was brought to the subclavian insertion site and trimmed so that the tip would lie at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium based on fluoroscopic guidelines.  The peel-away sheath was passed over the guidewire and then the 4-French catheter was deployed through the peel-away sheath.  There was easy blood return and fluoroscopic imaging showed initially the catheter had transited across the mediastinum up the opposite subclavian vein, then it was withdrawn and easily replaced in the superior vena cava.  The catheter insertion site was closed with one buried 5-0 Monocryl stitch and the same 5-0 Monocryl was used to tether the catheter at the exit site until fibrous ingrowth of the attached cuff has occurred.  Heparinized saline solution was used to flush the line.  A sterile occlusive dressing was applied, and the line was prepared for immediate use.  The patient was transported to the recovery room in good condition.  There were no intraoperative complications, and her blood loss was between 5 and 10 mL during the line placement portion of the procedure.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
  Arm and leg jerking.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
The patient is a 10-day-old Caucasian female here for approximately 1 minute bilateral arm and leg jerks, which started at day of life 1 and have occurred 6 total times since then.  Mom denies any apnea, perioral cyanosis, or color changes.  These movements are without any back arching.  They mainly occur during sleep, so mom is unaware of any eye rolling.  Mom is able to wake the patient up during this periods and stop the patient's extremity movements.

Otherwise, this patient has been active, breast-feeding well, although she falls asleep at the breast.  She is currently taking in 15 to 20 minutes of breast milk every 2 to 3 hours.  She is having increased diapers up to 8 wet and 6 to 7 dirty-yellow stools per day.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
  Negative fever, negative fussiness, tracks with her eyes, some sneezing and hiccups.  This patient has developed some upper airway congestion in the past day.  She has not had any vomiting or diarrhea.  Per mom, she does not spit up, and mom is also unable to notice any relationship between these movements and feeds.  This patient has not had any rashes.

The maternal grandmother is notable for hypertension and diabetes.  There are no other children in the family who see a specialist or no child death less than 1 year of age.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature was 97.5, heart rate was 150, blood pressure was 88/53, respiratory rate was 37 on room air.  Weight was 4 kg, this placed her at the 75th to 90th percentile; the length was 52 cm, this places her at the 75th to 90th percentile, and head circumference was 36 cm, which places her at the 75th percentile.
GENERAL:  In no acute distress, alert, nonfussy, active, breast-feeding well.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic head.  Negative for any cephalohematomas.  The anterior fontanelle was soft, open, and flat.  Bilateral red reflexes were positive.  The extraocular muscles were intact.  The tympanic membranes were clear.  Negative rhinorrhea.  The oropharynx is clear with intact hard and soft palates.  There was an Epstein pearl approximately 1 to 2 o'clock on the upper palate.
NECK:  Negative for swelling or clavicular crepitus.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart was regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs.  Femoral pulses were positive.  Capillary refill was less than 2 seconds.

LABORATORY DATA: 
 CBC showed a white blood cell count of 7.5 with a differential of 13% segmental cells, 5% bands, 60% lymphocytes, hemoglobin was 20.2, hematocrit was 57.9, and a platelet count was slightly elevated at 437,000.  A CRP was less than 0.3.  CMP showed a sodium of 136, potassium of 5.3, chloride of 106, bicarbonate of 23, BUN of 5, creatinine of 0.4, glucose of 93, calcium was 11.1.  T and direct bilirubin were 8.4 and 0.  Liver function tests include an AST of 50, an ALT of 10, and an alkaline phosphatase of 173.

A urinalysis was negative only showing 0 to 5 epithelial cells and trace crystals.

Current pending studies include CSF studies such as a Gram stain, culture, glucose, protein, cell count, and HSV PCR.  Also, pending include a head CT and a blood and urine culture.


ASSESSMENT:
  A 10-day-old neonate with:
1.  Seizure-like activity.
2.  Physiologic jaundice of the newborn.


DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES: 
 In this patient includes:
1.  Infantile spasms.
2.  Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus - this patient's movements occur during sleep and consist of extremity jerking.  Also compatible with this diagnosis includes the fact that mom is able to stop these movements.
3.  Hyperekplexia - this patient though is without any startle movements or stiffness.
4.  Trauma - possibilities include any type of intracranial hemorrhage, subdural or epidural.  This patient though is without any rapidly declining neurologic deficits currently.
5.  Neonatal hypoxemia - there is no history of hypoxemic events at birth.
6.  Central nervous system infection or bacteremia - possibilities include bacterial meningitis.  The most likely bacteria include group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria.  Also to consider include herpes simplex virus encephalitis or urosepsis.  This patient though is with a normal urinalysis currently, normal CBC without fever or lethargy in her history and not toxic appearing currently.
7.  Metabolic causes causing seizures including hypocalcemia and hypoglycemia - this patient is with a normal complete metabolic panel.
8.  Congenital brain abnormality - so far this patient is with a normal neuro and developmental exam.
9.  Drug withdrawal or intoxication - this could always be a possibility, but the patient's parents are seemingly good parents with a good social history not raising any flags for abuse.


PLAN:

1.  Currently this patient has pending CSF studies including a culture plus blood and urine culture.  Also, pending right now is an HSV PCR.  In the meantime, we will start antibiotics including ampicillin, gentamicin, and acyclovir to cover for the most likely bacterial and viral pathogens, especially herpes virus.
2.  We will obtain a head CT tonight to rule out any trauma or bleeds in brain.
3.  We will place this patient on continuous cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring and document vitals during any seizure-like activity.
4.  We will obtain an EEG in the morning in addition to a neurology consult.
5.  We will continue to monitor this patient's jaundice, which has decreased since her discharge from the hospital.
6.  These initial plans were all discussed with mom at the bedside, including the risks and benefits of a lumbar puncture, which has already been performed.

3-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION


This patient is undergoing 3-dimensionally planned radiation therapy in order to adequately target structures at risk while diminishing the degree of exposure to uninvolved adjacent normal structures.  This optimizes the chance of controlling tumor while diminishing the acute and long-term side effects.  With conformal 3-dimensional simulation, there is extended physician, therapist, and dosimetrist effort and time expended.  The patient is initially taken into a conventional simulator room where appropriate markers are placed and the patient is positioned and immobilized.  Preliminary filed sizes and arrangements, including gantry angles, collimator angles, and number of fields are conceived.  Radiographs are taken and these films are approved by the physician.  Appropriate marks are placed on the patient's skin or on the  immobilization device.

The patient is transferred to the diagnostic facility and placed on a flat CT scan table.  Scans are performed through the targeted area.  The scans are evaluated by the radiation oncologist and the tumor volume, target volume, and critical structures are outlined on the CT images.  The dosimetrist then evaluates the slices in the treatment-planning computer with appropriately marked structures.  This volume is reconstructed in a virtual 3-dimensional space utilizing the beam's-eye view features.  Appropriate blocks are designed.  Multiplane computerized dosimetry is performed throughout the volume.  Field arrangements and blocking are modified as necessary to provide coverage of the target volume while minimizing dose to normal structures.

Once appropriate beam parameters and isodose distributions have been confirmed on the computer scan, the individual slices are then reviewed by the physician.  The beam's-eye view, block design, and appropriate volumes are also printed and reviewed by the physician.  Once these are approved, physical blocks or multi-leaf collimator equivalents will be devised.  If significant changes are made in the field arrangements from the original simulation, the patient is brought back to the simulator where computer designed fields are re-simulated.

In view of the extensive effort and time expenditure required, this procedure justifies the special procedure code, 77470.

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
2.  Streptococcal pneumonia with sepsis.


CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 Unobtainable as the patient is intubated for respiratory failure.


CURRENT HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 This is a 20-year-old female who presented with symptoms of pneumonia and developed rapid sepsis and respiratory failure requiring intubation.  At this time, she is being treated aggressively with mechanical ventilation and other supportive measures and has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation with prolonged partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer.  At this time, I am being consulted for further evaluation and recommendations for treatment.  The nurses report that she has actually improved clinically over the last 24 hours.  Bleeding has been a problem; however, it seems to have been abrogated at this time with factor replacement as well as platelet infusion.  There is no prior history of coagulopathy.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
Otherwise nondescript as is the past surgical history.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  
There were possible illicit drugs.  Her family is present, and I have discussed her case with her mother and sister.


FAMILY HISTORY:  
Otherwise noncontributory.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 Not otherwise pertinent.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL:  She is a sedated, young black female in no acute distress, lying in bed intubated.
VITAL SIGNS:  She has a rate of 67, blood pressure of 100/60, and the respiratory rate per the ventilator approximately 14 to 16.
HEENT:  Her sclerae showed conjunctival hemorrhage.  There are no petechiae.  Her nasal vestibules are clear.  Oropharynx has ET tube in place.
NECK:  No jugular venous pressure distention.
CHEST:  Coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with good bowel sounds.  There was some oozing around the site of her central line.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  There is no evidence of compromise arterial blood flow at the digits or of her hands or feet.


LABORATORY STUDIES:  
The DIC parameters with a platelet count of approximately 50,000, INR of 2.4, normal PTT at this time, fibrinogen of 200, and a D-dimer of 13.


IMPRESSION/PLAN:  
At this time is disseminated intravascular coagulation from sepsis from pneumococcal disease.  My recommendation for the patient is to continue factor replacement as you are.  It seems that her clinical course is reversing and simple factor replacement is probably is the best measure at this time.  There is no indication at this point for Xigris.  However, if her coagulopathy does not resolve within the next 24 hours and continue to improve with an elevated fibrinogen, normalization of her coagulation times, I would consider low-dose continuous infusion heparin for abrogation of consumption of coagulation routines and continued supportive infusions.  I will repeat her laboratory studies in the morning and give more recommendations at that time.

SUBJECTIVE:  
School reports continuing difficulties with repetitive questioning, obsession with cleanness on a daily basis, concerned about his inability to relate this well in the classroom.  He appears confused and depressed at times.  Mother also indicates that preservative questioning had come down, but he started collecting old little toys that he did in the past.  He will attend social skills program in the summer.  ABCD indicated to me that they have identified two psychologists to refer him to for functional behavioral analysis.  There is lessening of tremoring in both hands since discontinuation of Zoloft.  He is now currently taking Abilify at 7.5 mg.


OBJECTIVE: 
 He came in less perseverative questioning, asked appropriate question about whether I talked to ABCD or not, greeted me with Japanese word to say hello, seemed less.

I also note that his tremors were less from the last time.


ASSESSMENT: 
 299.8 Asperger disorder, 300.03 obsessive compulsive disorder.


PLAN:
  Decrease Abilify from 7.5 mg to 5 mg tablet one a day, no refills needed.  I am introducing slow Luvox 25 mg tablet one-half a.m. for OCD symptoms, if no side effects in one week we will to tablet one up to therapeutic level.

I also will call ABCD regarding the referral to psychologists for functional behavioral analysis.  Parents will call me in two weeks.  I will see him for medication review in four weeks.  Mother signed informed consent.  I reviewed side effects to observe including behavioral activation.

Abilify has been helpful in decreasing high emotional arousal.  Combination of medication and behavioral intervention is recommended.

REASON FOR REFERRAL:
  Evaluation for right L4 selective nerve root block.


CHIEF COMPLAINT:
      Right lower extremity pain and back pain.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  Ms. XYZ is a 76-year-old resident of ASDF.  She is seen at the request of Dr. ABC.  She carries a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.  She underwent an L3-4 decompression in Month DD, YYYY by Dr. Stanley Gertzbein for back and bilateral lower extremity pain.  Shortly after surgery, she began having pain in the right L4 distribution and is seen today with an outside lumbar MRI only.  I have a report of a lumbar CT myelogram as well, but no films.  She has apparently spondylolisthesis and L4-5 stenosis with right posterior surgical fusion changes evident at both levels.  According to Dr. Reitman's notes, she is being sent for an L4 selective nerve root block to rule out whether or not she would be a candidate for a TLIF at L4-5.  Her MRI films are reviewed.  These reveal grade 2 L4 anterior spondylolisthesis without significant canal stenosis, though she has facet joint arthropathy at this level and dorsal postoperative changes.  She has a foraminal disc protrusion on the right, as well as a severely degenerated disc at L3-4.

The patient complains essentially of pain along the anterior tibia and along the right hip, which his burning, shooting, aching and constant in nature.  It is worse with standing and walking.  She can walk about a block before her symptoms become debilitating.  She is more comfortable in recumbency.  She denies bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle area hypoesthesia, numbness, tingling, weakness or Valsalva related exacerbation.  She rates her pain as 9/10 in average and her daily level of intensity and 5/10 for her least level of pain.  Alleviating factors include sitting, recumbency, sleeping, and massage.  She treats her pain with Tylenol currently.


OSWESTRY PAIN INVENTORY:
  Significant impact on almost every aspect of her quality of life.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  As per above.  Adult-onset diabetes.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
  Eye surgery, cataract surgery and lumbar decompression.


MEDICATIONS:
  Lotrel, Diovan, Pravastatin, Toprol, Actos, aspirin.


ALLERGIES:
  No known drug allergies.  No shellfish or iodine allergy.


FAMILY HISTORY:
  Family history is remarkable for heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension.


SOCIAL HISTORY:
  The patient is retired.  She is married with three grown children.  Has a high school level education.  She does not smoke, drink or utilize illicit substances.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
  A thirteen-point review of systems was surveyed and is otherwise negative.  The patient denies any other constitutional symptom.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
  Temp 97.7, pulse 78, BP 143/80.  The patient walks with a slight forward stooped gait.  There is no spasticity or ataxia.  She has mild antalgia after a few steps to the right lower extremity.  She has limited lumbar flexion, lumbar extension and right ipsilateral bending with provocable right leg pain.  There is no clear pelvic asymmetry.  Her gait is forward stooped.

Head is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.  There is no occipitalgic tenderness.  The neck is supple with a slight limitation of cervical extension and lateral bending.  She has a cervicothoracic kyphotic posture with internal rotation of the shoulders.

Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Heart has regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen is obese, nontender, nondistended without palpable organomegaly or pulsatile masses.  The skin is warm and dry to touch.  There is no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Degenerative changes are noted in the joints of the hands, knees and ankles.  Brisk capillary refill is noted to all nailbeds.

Inspection and palpation of her axial skeleton reveals a well-healed midline lumbar scar with slight bony step-off evident at the upper edge of the scar.  No skin tags or clefts are noted.  There is mild lumbar paraspinous hypertonicity, which appears to be more prominent on the right.  There is mild midline tenderness over the surgical scar, as well as mild PSIS tenderness.

Motor and sensory examination of the lower extremities is intact.  She has hypoactive, but elicitable upper and lower extremity reflexes, though no Achilles reflexes can be elicited.  Upper extremity range of motion and neurologic exam is within normal limits.  No long tract signs are evident.  There is no fasciculation, atrophy, or clonus.

In the supine position, straight leg raise testing produces axial low back pain.  There is no sciatic notch tenderness and no particular greater trochanteric bursal tenderness.


IMPRESSION: 
 
1.  Lumbar spondylolisthesis.
2.  Lumbar spinal stenosis.
3.  Lumbar radiculopathy.


PLAN:
  The risks and benefits of right L4 selective nerve root block were discussed in detail with the patient and they include failure of pain relief, need for further procedures, infection, bleeding, damage to the spinal nerves or abdominal viscera, and postdural puncture headaches.  She wished to proceed.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Chronic otitis media with effusion.
2.  Conductive hearing loss.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Chronic otitis media with effusion.
2.  Conductive hearing loss.


PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
 Bilateral tympanostomy with myringotomy tube placement _______ split tube 1.0 mm.


ANESTHESIA:  
Total IV general mask airway.


ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  
None.


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
  The patient is a 1-year-old male with a history of chronic otitis media with effusion and conductive hearing loss refractory to outpatient medical therapy.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the family, a written consent was obtained for the procedure.


PROCEDURE:
  The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia.  The patient was placed on the operating table in supine position.  After this, the patient was then placed under general mask airway and the patient's head was then turned to the left.

The Zeiss operative microscope and medium-sized ear speculum were placed and the cerumen from the external auditory canals were removed with a cerumen loop to #5 suction.  After this, the tympanic membrane is then brought into direct visualization with no signs of any gross retracted pockets or cholesteatoma.  A myringotomy incision was then made within the posterior inferior quadrant and the middle ear was then suctioned with a #5 suction demonstrating dry contents.  A _____ split tube 1.0 mm was then placed in the myringotomy incision utilizing a alligator forcep.  Cortisporin Otic drops were placed followed by cotton balls.  Attention was then drawn to the left ear with the head turned to the right and the medium sized ear speculum placed.  The external auditory canal was removed off of its cerumen with a #5 suction which led to the direct visualization of the tympanic membrane.  The tympanic membrane appeared with no signs of retraction pockets, cholesteatoma or air fluid levels.  A myringotomy incision was then made within the posterior inferior quadrant with a myringotomy blade after which a _________ split tube 1.0 mm was then placed with an alligator forcep.  After this, the patient had Cortisporin Otic drops followed by cotton balls placed.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia and transferred to recovery room in stable condition and tolerated the procedure very well.  The patient will be followed up approximately in one week and was sent home with a prescription for Ciloxan ear drops to be used as directed and with instructions not to get any water in the ears.

INFORMANT:
  Dad on phone.  Transferred from ABCD Memorial Hospital, rule out sepsis.


HISTORY:  
This is a 3-week-old, NSVD, Caucasian baby boy transferred from ABCD Memorial Hospital for rule out sepsis and possible congenital heart disease.  The patient had a fever of 100.1 on 09/13/2006 taken rectally, and mom being a nurse, took the baby to the hospital and he was admitted for rule out sepsis.  All the sepsis workup was done, CBC, UA, LP, and CMP, and since a murmur was noted 2/5, he also had an echo done.  The patient was put on ampicillin and cefotaxime.  Echo results came back and they showed patent foramen ovale/ASD with primary pulmonary stenosis and then considering severe congenital heart disease, he was transferred here on vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefotaxime.  The patient was n.p.o. when he came in.  He was on 3/4 L of oxygen.  According to the note, it conveyed that he had some subcostal retractions.  On arriving here, baby looks very healthy.  He has no subcostal retractions.  He is not requiring any oxygen and he is positive for urine and stool.  The stool is although green in color, and in the morning today, he spiked a fever of 100.1, but right now he is afebrile.  ED called that case is a direct admit.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
The patient supposedly had fever, some weight loss, poor appetite.  The day he had fever, no rash, no ear pain, no congestion, no rhinorrhea, no throat pain, no neck pain, no visual changes, no conjunctivitis, no cough, no dyspnea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, and no dysuria.  According to mom, baby felt floppy on the day of fever and he also used to have stools every day 4 to 6 which is yellowish-to-green in color, but today the stool we noticed was green in color.  He usually has urine 4 to 5 a day, but the day he had fever, his urine also was low.  Mom gave baby some Pedialyte.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  None.


HOSPITALIZATIONS:
  Recent transfer from ABCD for the rule out sepsis and heart disease.

LABORATORY DATA:
  As drawn on 09/13/2006 at ABCD showed WBC 4.2, hemoglobin 11.8, hematocrit 34.7, platelets 480,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.9, chloride 105, bicarbonate 28, BUN 7, creatinine 0.4, glucose 80, CRP 0.5.  Neutrophils 90, bands 7, lymphocytes 27, monocytes 12, and eosinophils 4.  Chest x-ray done on 09/13/2006 read as mild left upper lobe infiltrate, but as seen here, and discussed with Dr. X, we did not see any infiltrate and CBG was normal.  UA and LP results are pending.  Also pending are cultures for blood, LP, and urine.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
 This is a 3-week-old Caucasian baby boy admitted for rule out sepsis and congenital heart disease.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE/PULMONARY: 
 Afebrile with so far 20-hour blood cultures, LP and urine cultures are negative.  We will get all the results from ABCD and until then we will continue to rule out sepsis protocol and put the patient on ampicillin and cefotaxime.  The patient could be having fever due to mild gastroenteritis or urinary tract infection, so to rule out all these things we have to wait for all the results.

CVS: 
 He had a grade 2/5 murmur status post echo, which showed a patent foramen ovale, as well as primary pulmonary stenosis.  These are the normal findings in a newborn as discussed with Dr. Y, so we will just observe the patient.  He does not need any further workup.

GASTROINTESTINAL: 
 The patient is slowly breast-fed with positive urine and stool.  The chest x-ray mentions of distended bowel, but right now he passed stools and also some gas, but since the color of the stool was green, we will send for Wright stain.

FEN:  
PO ad lib and document weight gain.


DISPOSITION: 
 Discharge to home once the cultures are negative.

REASON FOR REFERRAL: 
 Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.


RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.


HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:
  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt &quot;just like the stroke.&quot;  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing &quot;mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,&quot; but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.

Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.

Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.


OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  
As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it &quot;every other night.&quot;  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times &quot;snoring&quot; and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).


CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
 Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.


SUBSTANCE USE:
  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.  She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago.


FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history.  She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer.  Her father has gout and blood clots.  Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors.  She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 Ms. A completed high school degree.  She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school.  She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity.

She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing.  As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition.  She is now living on her own.  She has never driven.  She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning.  She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters.  She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation.  She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away.  She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.


PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: 
 Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events.  She reported that this only &quot;comes and goes.&quot;

BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:  
Ms. A arrived alone and on time for her appointment.  She walked with a cane and was short of breath while walking.  No other significant psychomotor abnormalities were noted.  Vision and hearing appeared to be adequate for testing, although she did indicate that she needed to update her eyeglass prescription.  She was appropriately dressed and groomed.  Rapport was easily established and eye contact was appropriate.  She was oriented to person and place, but not fully oriented to time as she said that it was Monday rather than Tuesday.  She was very talkative and speech tended to be somewhat disorganized and circumstantial.  She had difficulty answering questions in a concise and succinct manner with notable difficulties in generalizing her experience (e.g. tended to respond to general questions in a very specific manner with a high level of detail).  She would at times talk while completing tasks and was reminded to focus on the task at hand.  Receptive language abilities appeared to be within broad normal limits as she was able to appropriately respond to the examiner's questions and instructions.

Thought processes were somewhat circumstantial as already noted, but no overt thought disturbances were noted.  Mood appeared to be euthymic.  Affect was full ranged.  She was noted to be somewhat impulsive and disinhibited and the vowel receptive language abilities were intact.  In general, she had difficulty responding to more abstract or general questions.  She was noted to be very tired throughout the evaluation.  She said that she fell asleep during a sustained attention task, although this was not noted by the examiner.  The examiner did observe her falling asleep at points during task instructions and she also slept in the lobby throughout lunchtime and had to be awoken to resume testing.  Her fatigue likely affected her performance on certain tasks.

Overall, Ms. A appeared to put full effort into all the tasks during this evaluation although as noted her fatigue likely impacted her performance to some degree and these test results will be interpreted with that in mind.  The patient did not recognize this examiner when she returned for this evaluation.


GENERAL COGNITIVE ABILITY:  
Premorbid intellectual functioning as assessed with the word reading test fell in the average to low average range.  Her performances on measures assessing current intellectual functioning suggested some weaknesses in stored verbal knowledge and both verbal and visual abstract reasoning (all borderline).  Visuospatial construction was in the low average range.


ATTENTION:
  Ms. A demonstrated weaknesses in certain aspects of attention and concentration.  For auditory verbal information, she was able to accurately process basic immediate information, but had more difficulty when active attentional abilities were required and she had to manipulate information in mind.  On visually-based tasks, again simple attentional abilities such as visual scanning and basic processing of information were within the average range; however, it was noted that there was a trade-off between speed and accuracy in her performances on more complex attentional tasks that required greater levels of focus as she tended to complete the task slowly in order to accurately discriminate between target and nontarget visual stimuli.  On a visual sustained attention task, her overall number of errors and response rate were within broad normal limits, but it was noted that her response speed slowed and the accuracy of her responses became less consistent as the test progressed suggesting weaknesses in vigilance.  It was also noted that she was slower to respond and there was more variability in response accuracy when stimuli were presented with longer interstimulus intervals suggesting some weaknesses in arousal and activation when information was presented at a slower rate.  Taking together these results highlight deficits in working memory (e.g. complex attention and mental manipulation), sustained attention and vigilance while her more basic and immediate attentional abilities were within broad normal limits.  Fatigue was likely a factor in these results.  It is unlikely that Ms. A actually fell asleep during this task as her error rate is not very high; however, there were noted decreases in measures that are sensitive to arousal and activation.


INFORMATION PROCESSING SPEED:  
As mentioned, Ms. A tended to perform within expected limits on brief verbal and visual tasks that involved basic processing.  She had more difficulty maintaining consistency in her response rate and tended to become slower on tasks that require sustained attention and more complex discrimination of stimuli.


LANGUAGE:  
Confrontation naming was in the impaired range, but this may be in part due to lack of familiarity with certain objects given her weak performance on tasks assessing stored verbal knowledge.  Minor errors were noted on sentence repetition task, but this may be due to weaknesses in attention and working memory.

Similarly, her low average performance on a verbal comprehension task may have been due to some weaknesses in vigilance as she was noted to fall asleep at times during this task.  Verbal fluency for both phonemic and semantic cues was within the average range.  As taken together some weaknesses in aspects of language appear to have been due to limitations in attention and verbal knowledge store.


VISUOSPATIAL PERCEPTION AND ORGANIZATION:  
Ms. A performed within the average range and within expected limits on visuospatial construction tasks that involved matching to a sample using either blocks or drawing; however, she had notable difficulties when we attempted to assess her perception of angular line orientations.  These results suggest some reliance on external cues and information for accurate interpretation of visuospatial stimuli and difficulty with perception when such cues are not present to structure her perception.  Note that fatigue may have also been a factor here as well.


LEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS:


  
VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY: 
 On contextual memory task (i.e. stories), Ms. A performed in the borderline range in immediate recall.  Following a delay, she retained 62% of the information that she originally learned and recall was again in the borderline range.  Delayed recognition was low average.  On a task assessing her ability to learn large amounts of seemingly unorganized information (i.e. list), her initial acquisition of information was in the low average range.  With repetition, her performance improved and her overall immediate learning fell in the average range.  Following a short delay, she was only able to spontaneously recall about a third of the information that she had initially learned and her overall performance fell in the borderline range.  With cueing, she was able to recall more information, but relative to her same age peers this performance still fell in the borderline range.  Recall following a long delay was in the borderline to low average range and recognition was borderline as she did not recognize a number of the original target stimuli.  Of note, she made a number of repetitions and intrusion errors some of which were semantically related to the list target items and were repeatedly given suggesting some difficulty in correcting her responses with feedback and in monitoring or organizing her responses.  Taken together these results highlight difficulties in learning large amounts of verbal information due primarily to difficulties with the initial organizing or learning of the information, although some weaknesses in retrieval were also noted.  These results are likely due to the above noted attention and working memory deficits as she was able to at least recognize most of the information that she had initially learned.
 
  
NON-VERBAL/VISUAL LEARNING AND MEMORY: 
 Ms. A's initial recall of the details in spatial location of the series of visual designs is in the low average range.  She retained most of this information following a delay with recall and recognition falling in the average range.  Immediate recall of a complex figure drawing was in the average range.  Following a 30-minute delay, she retained most of this information although statistically her result fell in the low average range.  Recognition of the individual component parts of the larger figure fell in the low average range.  Taken together these results suggest that Ms. A was mildly limited in the amount of information that she could initially learn, but the fact that she was able to retain most of that information over time suggests that any difficulties in learning visual information occurred during initial encoding.  This pattern of results is similar to those found for verbal information.


EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING: 
 Ms. A performed within the low average-to-average range on tasks assessing verbal fluency, cognitive set shifting, and inhibition of prepotent responses; however, it should be noted that Ms. A made a number of errors on these tasks particularly for inhibition, although she was able to successfully correct those errors.

Across tasks and during interactions it was noted that Ms. A had some weaknesses in organization.  Visual and verbal abstract reasoning were in the borderline range and deficits in working memory were noted.  Taken together these results highlight some weaknesses in executive functioning.


MOTOR/PSYCHOMOTOR FUNCTIONING: 
 Ms. A performed in the impaired range with her dominant right hand and her nondominant hand on a task assessing speeded fine motor coordination.


EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING: 
 Ms. A's overall score on a self-report effective screening measure suggested that she is currently experiencing mild levels of depression.  She endorsed symptoms related to dysphoria, anxiety, lack of energy, anhedonia, hopelessness, and cognitive problems.


SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS: 
 Ms. A was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X, M.D. to follow up noted cognitive weaknesses following a right middle cerebral artery stroke that was seen on a neuropsychological screening.  Test results suggested that Ms. A was premorbidly performing in the low average to average range.  Based on this estimate, she performed within expected limits on tasks assessing immediate attention and speed for processing brief, simple, and straightforward information.  Most aspects of language (i.e. repetition, comprehension, and fluency), and visuospatial construction (i.e. matching to sample).  Deficits were seen primarily in the areas of complex attention or working memory and sustained attention.  She had difficulty mentally manipulating information in mind and on longer task that required focus.  She demonstrated poor vigilance, difficulty with discrimination of stimuli, and declines in arousal and activation.  These attentional deficits affected her ability to learn verbal and visual information.  Weaknesses in executive functioning were also noted based on her performances across tasks as well as behavioral observations as she demonstrated weaknesses in abstract thinking, organization, inhibition, and behavioral and response regulation.  Combined with the deficits seen for fine motor skills, these results are consistent with frontal subcortical changes as were seen on her CAT scan.  In addition, Ms. A demonstrated some difficulty completing a task that involved interpreting directionally based visuospatial stimuli in the absence of other cues to aid with perception and these findings may be consistent with the involvement of the right hemisphere in her recent stroke; however, given that no MRI was conducted it is difficult to say whether or not there are specific regions of infarct in her right hemisphere.

Overall, these results are consistent with those seen on her recent neuropsychological screening.  This evaluation was requested in order to further clarify those results.  As noted above, Ms. A does have a number of areas of deficit; however, these results do not support a dementing process at this time.  The pattern of findings as mentioned are consistent with subcortical changes, but may also be secondary to her poorly treated sleep apnea as she was noticeably tired and particular deficits were noticed on tasks that required complex or sustained attention.  Thus it will be important for Ms. A to increase compliance with treatment for sleep apnea and also to ensure that other cardiovascular risk factors are monitored and controlled through diet, exercise, and medication.  Given that she is working full-time and these cognitive deficits could create significant problems on the job, it will be important that Ms. A address these issues while she is still completing a lighter load at work.  Additional recommendations are provided below.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  It is imperative that Ms. A address her sleep apnea and comply consistently i.e. every evening with wearing her CPAP.  Given that she continues to complain about it and report the claustrophobia prevents her from using it regularly, Ms. A should see a sleep specialist in order to determine alternate ways to address this problem.
2.  Ms. A reported mild levels of depression and anxiety on this evaluation and it was previously recommended that she contact XYZ to inquire about counseling and management of multiple life stressors.
3.  Ms. A should see an ophthalmologist to update her eyeglass prescription.  It may have contributed to the noted deficits on one visuospatial task.
4.  Continued PT and home exercises I recommended to improve physical abilities.
5.  Ms. A is likely not obtaining enough physical exercise and it is suggested that she work with her physical therapist and primary care physician to determine exercise regimen in order to help her lose weight.
6.  The following recommendations are provided to aid Ms. A with the noted difficulties with attention and memory.  She may also benefit from cognitive therapy in order to learn to apply these strategies at work.
7.  Ms. A's cardio and cerebrovascular risk factors should be closely monitored and the results of this evaluation should be shared with all of her physicians.

Thank you for referring this interesting patient for evaluation.  A neuropsychological reevaluation is recommended in one to two years in order to monitor cognitive functioning.  Reevaluation should occur earlier if there is any worsening of cognitive functioning.

INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY


Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a complex set of procedures which requires appropriate positioning and immobilization typically with customized immobilization devices.  The treatment planning process requires at least 4 hours of physician time.  The technology is appropriate in this patient's case due to the fact that the target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures.  Sequential CT scans are obtained and transferred to the treatment planning software.  Extensive analysis occurs.  The target volumes, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected.  In addition, organs at risk are outlined.  Doses are selected both for targets, as well as for organs at risk.  Associated dose constraints are placed.  Inverse treatment planning is then performed in conjunction with the physics staff.  These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician.  Multiple beam arrangements may be tested for appropriateness and optimal dose delivery in order to maximize the chance of controlling disease, while minimizing exposure to organs at risk.  This is performed in hopes of minimizing associated complications.  The physician delineates the treatment type, number of fractions and total volume.  During the time of treatment, there is extensive physician intervention, monitoring the patient set up and tolerance.  In addition, specific QA is performed by the physics staff under the physician's direction.

In view of the above, the special procedure code 77470 is deemed appropriate.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Lumbar spondylosis.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Lumbar spondylosis.


OPERATION PERFORMED:
  Lumbar facet injections done under fluoroscopic control.


ANESTHESIA:
  Local and IV.


COMPLICATIONS:
  None.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  
After proper consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the fluoroscopy suite and placed in a prone position on a fluoroscopy table with abdominal rolls in place.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile classical fashion.  The patient was monitored with blood pressure cuff, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximeter.  The patient was given oxygen, intravenous sedation and analgesics as needed.  The facets were identified and marked under fluoroscopic control by rotating the C-arm obliquely, laterally and caudocranial as needed for optimal visualization of the facet joint's &quot;Scottie dog&quot; and the opening of the facet.

After each facet joint was identified and marked, local anesthesia was infiltrated subcutaneously and deep over each of the identified facets.  A 22-gauge spinal needle was then utilized to cannulate the facet joint under fluoroscopic control utilizing a gun barrel technique.  After negative aspiration, 0.25 - 0.5 cc of Omnipaque 240 contrast media was injected into the facet as an arthrogram to visualize the joint and the capsule.  After another negative aspiration, 1cc of a 10cc solution of Marcaine 0.5% and 100 milligrams of methyl prednisolone acetate was injected into each facet.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without apparent difficulty or complication unless otherwise noted.

Cardiac:  Rhythm regular.
Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  Neither liver, spleen, nor other masses palpable.
Lower Extremities:  Without edema.
Neurologic:  Awake, alert, ambulatory, oriented, cognitively intact.

I reviewed the CT images and report of the study done on May 1.  This showed no evidence of metabolically active malignancy.

Most recent laboratory studies were performed last September and the TSH was normal.  I have asked him to repeat the TSH at the one year anniversary.

He is on no current medications.

In summary, this 57-year-old man presented with T1 N3 cancer of the nasopharynx and is now at 20 months post completion of all therapy.  He has made a good recovery.  We will continue to follow thyroid function and I have asked him to obtain a TSH at the one year anniversary in September and CBC in follow up.  We will see him in six months' time with a PET-CT.

He returns to the general care and direction of Dr. ABC.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Extremely large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Extremely large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid.


TITLE OF OPERATION: 
 Excision of large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid, and repaired with used dorsal conjunctival flap in the upper lid and a large preauricular skin graft.


PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was brought into the operating room and prepped and draped in usual fashion.  Xylocaine 2% with epinephrine was injected beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the lower lid and also beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the upper lid.  A frontal nerve block was also given on the right upper lid.  The anesthetic agent was also injected in the right preauricular region which would provide a donor graft for the right lower lid defect.  The area was marked with a marking pen with margins of 3 to 4 mm, and a #15 Bard-Parker blade was used to make an incision at the nasal and temporal margins of the lesion.

The incision was carried inferiorly, and using a Steven scissors the normal skin, muscle, and conjunctiva was excised inferiorly.  The specimen was then marked and sent to pathology for frozen section.  Bleeding was controlled with a wet-field cautery, and the right upper lid was everted, and an incision was made 3 mm above the lid margin with the Bard-Parker blade in the entire length of the upper lid.  The incision reached the orbicularis, and Steven scissors were used to separate the tarsus from the underlying orbicularis.  Vertical cuts were made nasally and temporally, and a large dorsal conjunctival flap was fashioned with the conjunctiva attached superiorly.  It was placed into the defect in the lower lid and sutured with multiple interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures nasally, temporally, and inferiorly.

The defect in the skin was measured and an appropriate large preauricular graft was excised from the right preauricular region.  The defect was closed with interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures, and the preauricular graft was sutured in place with multiple interrupted 6-0 silk sutures.  The upper border of the graft was attached to the upper lid after incision was made in the gray line with a Superblade, and the superior portion of the skin graft was sutured to the upper lid through the anterior lamella created by the razor blade incision.

Cryotherapy was then used to treat the nasal and temporal margins of the area of excision because of positive margins, and following this an antibiotic steroid ointment was instilled and a light pressure dressing was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in good condition.

HISTORY:  
We had the pleasure of seeing the patient today in our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic.  He was sent here with a chief complaint of joint pain in several joints for few months.  This is a 7-year-old white male who has no history of systemic disease, who until 2 months ago, was doing well and 2 months ago, he started to complain of pain in his fingers, elbows, and neck.  At this moment, this is better and is almost gone, but for several months, he was having pain to the point that he would cry at some point.  He is not a complainer according to his mom and he is a very active kid.  There is no history of previous illness to this or had gastrointestinal problems.  He has problems with allergies, especially seasonal allergies and he takes Claritin for it.  Other than that, he has not had any other problem.  Denies any swelling except for that doctor mentioned swelling on his elbow.  There is no history of rash, no stomach pain, no diarrhea, no fevers, no weight loss, no ulcers in his mouth except for canker sores.  No lymphadenopathy, no eye problems, and no urinary problems.


MEDICATIONS: 
 His medications consist only of Motrin only as needed and Claritin currently for seasonal allergies and rhinitis.


ALLERGIES: 
 He has no allergies to any drugs.


BIRTH HISTORY:  
Pregnancy and delivery with no complications.  He has no history of hospitalizations or surgeries.


FAMILY HISTORY: 
 Positive for arthritis in his grandmother.  No history of pediatric arthritis.  There is history of psoriasis in his dad.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 He lives with mom, dad, brother, sister, and everybody is healthy.  They live in Easton.  They have 4 dogs, 3 cats, 3 mules and no deer.  At school, he is in second grade and he is doing PE without any limitation.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature is 98.7, pulse is 96, respiratory rate is 24, height is 118.1 cm, weight is 22.1 kg, and blood pressure is 61/44.
GENERAL:  He is alert, active, in no distress, very cooperative.
HEENT:  He has no facial rash.  No lymphadenopathy.  Oral mucosa is clear.  No tonsillitis.  His ear canals are clear and pupils are reactive to light and accommodation.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.
HEART:  Regular rhythm and no murmur.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender with no visceromegaly.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Shows no limitation in any of his joints or active swelling today.  He has no tenderness either in any of his joints.  Muscle strength is 5/5 in proximal muscles.


LABORATORY DATA:
  Includes an arthritis panel.  It has normal uric acid, sedimentation rate of 2, rheumatoid factor of 6, and antinuclear antibody that is negative and C-reactive protein that is 7.1.  His mother stated that this was done while he was having symptoms.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
 This patient may have had reactive arthritis.  He is seen frequently and the patient has family history of psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis.  I do not see any problems at this moment on his laboratories or on his physical examination.  This may have been related to recent episode of viral infection or infection of some sort.  Mother was oriented about the finding and my recommendation is to observe him and if there is any recurrence of the symptoms or persistence of swelling or limitation in any of his joints, I will be glad to see him back.

If you have any question on further assessment and plan, please do no hesitate to contact us.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Basal cell carcinoma, nasal tip, previous positive biopsy.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Basal cell carcinoma, nasal tip, previous positive biopsy.


OPERATION PERFORMED: 
 Excision of nasal tip basal carcinoma.  Total area of excision, approximately 1 cm to 12 mm frozen section x2, final margins clear.


INDICATION: 
 A 66-year-old female for excision of nasal basal cell carcinoma.  This area is to be excised accordingly and closed.  We had multiple discussions regarding types of closure.


SUMMARY: 
 The patient was brought to the OR in satisfactory condition and placed supine on the OR table.  Underwent general anesthesia along with Marcaine in the nasal tip areas for planned excision.  The area was injected, after sterile prep and drape, with Marcaine 0.25% with 1:200,000 adrenaline.

The specimen was sent to pathology.  Margins were still positive at the inferior 6 o'clock ***** margin and this was resubmitted accordingly.  Final margins were clear.

Closure consisted of undermining circumferentially.  Advancement closure with dog ear removal distally and proximally was accomplished without difficulty.  Closure with interrupted 5-0 Monocryl running 7-0 nylon followed by Xeroform gauze, light pressure dressing, and Steri-Strips.

The patient is discharged on minocycline and Darvocet-N 100.


NOTE:
  The 2.6 mm loupe magnification was utilized throughout the procedure.  No complications noted with excellent and all clear margins at the termination.  An advancement closure technique was utilized.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  
The patient was brought to the Radiology Suite and placed prone onto a radiolucent table.  The C-arm was brought into the operative field and AP, left right oblique and lateral fluoroscopic images of the L1-2 through L5-S1 levels were obtained.  We then proceeded to prepare the low back with a Betadine solution and draped sterile.  Using an oblique approach to the spine, the L5-S1 level was addressed using an oblique projection angled C-arm in order to allow for perpendicular penetration of the disc space.  A metallic marker was then placed laterally and a needle entrance point was determined.  A skin wheal was raised with 1% Xylocaine and an #18-gauge needle was advanced up to the level of the disc space using AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopic projections.  A second needle, #22-gauge 6-inch needle was then introduced into the disc space and with AP and lateral fluoroscopic projections, was placed into the center of the nucleus.  We then proceeded to perform a similar placement of needles at the L4-5, L3-4 and L2-3 levels.

A solution of Isovue 300 with 1 gm of Ancef was then drawn into a 10 cc syringe and without informing the patient of our injecting, we then proceeded to inject the disc spaces sequentially.

To be arranged per the patient as the patient was discharged by court.


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 
 A 2-week supply of the following was phoned into the patient's pharmacy:  Seroquel 25 mg p.o. nightly.  Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.


MENTAL STATUS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
  Attitude was cooperative.  Appearance showed fair hygiene and grooming.  Psychomotor behavior showed restlessness.  No EPS or TD was noted.  Affect was restricted.  Mood remained anxious and speech was pressured.  Thoughts remained tangential, and the patient endorsed paranoid delusions.  The patient denied auditory hallucinations.  The patient denied suicidal or homicidal ideation, was oriented to person and place.  Overall, insight into her illness remained impaired.


HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE: 
 The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of bipolar affective disorder, was initially admitted for evaluation of increasing mood lability, disorganization, and inappropriate behaviors.  The patient reportedly was asking her father to have sex with her and tried to pull down her mother's pants.  The patient took her clothing off, was noted to be very disorganized sexually, and religiously preoccupied, and endorsed auditory hallucinations of voices telling her to calm herself and others.  The patient has a history of depression versus bipolar disorder, last hospitalized in Pierce County in 2008, but without recent treatment.  The patient on admission interview was noted to be labile and disorganized.  The patient was initiated on Risperdal M-Tab 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. for psychosis and mood lability, and also medically evaluated by Rebecca Richardson, MD.  The patient remained labile and suspicious during her hospital stay.  The patient continued to be sexually preoccupied and had poor insight into her need for treatment.  The patient denied further auditory hallucinations.  The patient was treated with Seroquel for persistent mood lability and psychosis.  The patient was noted to develop prolactinemia with Risperdal and this was changed to Zyprexa prior to discharge.  The patient remained disorganized, but was given a voluntary drop by prosecution against medical advice when she went to court on 01/11/2010.  The patient was discharged to return home to her parents and was referred to Community Mental Health Agencies.  The patient was thus discharged in symptomatic condition.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES

1.  EMG-proven left carpal tunnel syndrome.
2.  Tenosynovitis of the left third and fourth fingers at the A1 and A2 pulley level.
3.  Dupuytren's nodule in the palm.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES

1.  EMG-proven left carpal tunnel syndrome.
2.  Tenosynovitis of the left third and fourth fingers at the A1 and A2 pulley level.
3.  Dupuytren's nodule in the palm.


PROCEDURE: 
 Left carpal tunnel release with flexor tenosynovectomy; cortisone injection of trigger fingers, left third and fourth fingers; injection of Dupuytren's nodule, left palm.


ANESTHESIA: 
 Local plus IV sedation (MAC).


ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  
Zero.


SPECIMENS:  
None.


DRAINS: 
 None.


PROCEDURE DETAIL: 
 Patient brought to the operating room.  After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery.  Routine prep and drape was employed.  Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure.  Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder.  A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made.  Skin was sharply incised.  Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin.  Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm.  Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve.  Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal.  Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing.  Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free.  Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal.  Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium.  When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures.  A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort.  Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied.  Tourniquet was deflated.  Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits.  Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home.  Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n.  Patient asked to begin gentle active flexion, extension and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery.  She was asked to keep the dressings clean, dry and intact and follow up in my office.

hematology,"
        
        

        
        
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  The patient is well known to me for a history of iron-deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss from colitis.  We corrected her hematocrit last year with intravenous (IV) iron.  Ultimately, she had a total proctocolectomy done on 03/14/2007 to treat her colitis.  Her course has been very complicated since then with needing multiple surgeries for removal of hematoma.  This is partly because she was on anticoagulation for a right arm deep venous thrombosis (DVT) she had early this year, complicated by septic phlebitis.

Chart was reviewed, and I will not reiterate her complex history.

I am asked to see the patient again because of concerns for coagulopathy.

She had surgery again last month to evacuate a pelvic hematoma, and was found to have vancomycin resistant enterococcus, for which she is on multiple antibiotics and followed by infectious disease now.

She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as well.


LABORATORY DATA:
  Labs today showed a white blood count of 7.9, hemoglobin 11.0, hematocrit 32.8, and platelets 1,121,000.  MCV is 89.  Her platelets have been elevated for at least the past week, with counts initially at the 600,000 to 700,000 range and in the last couple of day rising above 1,000,000.  Her hematocrit has been essentially stable for the past month or so.  White blood count has improved.

PT has been markedly elevated and today is 44.9 with an INR of 5.0.  This is despite stopping Coumadin on 05/31/2007, and with administration of vitamin K via the TPN, as well as additional doses IV.  The PT is slightly improved over the last few days, being high at 65.0 with an INR of 7.3 yesterday.

PTT has not been checked since 05/18/2007 and was normal then at 28.

LFTs have been elevated.  ALT is 100, AST 57, GGT 226, alkaline phosphatase 505, albumin low at 3.3, uric acid high at 4.9, bilirubin normal, LDH normal, and pre-albumin low at 16.  Creatinine is at 1.5, with an estimated creatinine clearance low at 41.7.  Other electrolytes are fairly normal.

B12 was assessed on 05/19/2007 and was normal at 941.  Folic acid was normal.  Iron saturation has not been checked since March, and was normal then.  Ferritin has not been checked in a couple of months.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
 Erythropoietin 45,000 units every week, started 05/16/2007.  She is on heparin flushes, loperamide, niacin, pantoprazole, Diovan, Afrin nasal spray, caspofungin, daptomycin, Ertapenem, fentanyl or morphine p.r.n. pain, and Compazine or Zofran p.r.n. nausea.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 

GENERAL:  She is alert, and frustrated with her prolonged hospital stay.  She notes that she had epistaxis a few days ago, requiring nasal packing and fortunately that had resolved now.
VITAL SIGNS:  Today, temperature is 98.5, pulse 99, respirations 16, blood pressure 105/65, and pulse is 95.  She is not requiring oxygen.
SKIN:  No significant ecchymoses are noted.
ABDOMEN:  Ileostomy is in place, with greenish black liquid output.  Midline surgical scar has healed well, with a dressing in place in the middle, with no bleeding noted.
EXTREMITIES:  She has no peripheral edema.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate.
LYMPHATICS:  No adenopathy is noted.
LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally.


IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
  Markedly elevated PT/INR despite stopping Coumadin and administering vitamin K.  I will check mixing studies to see if she has deficiency, which could be due to poor production given her elevated LFTs, decreased albumin, and decreased pre-albumin.

It is possible that she has an inhibitor, which would have to be an acquired inhibitor, generally presenting with an elevated PTT and not PT.  I will check a PTT and check mixing studies if that is prolonged.  It is doubtful that she has a lupus anticoagulant since she has been presenting with bleeding symptoms rather than clotting.  I agree with continuing off of anticoagulation for now.

She has markedly elevated platelet count.  I suspect this is likely reactive to infection, and not from a new myeloproliferative disorder.

Anemia has been stable, and is multifactorial.  Given her decreased creatinine clearance, I agree with erythropoietin support.  She was iron deficient last year, and with her multiple surgeries and poor p.o. intake, may have become iron deficient again.  She has had part of her small bowel removed, so there may be a component of poor absorption as well.  If she is iron deficient, this may contribute also to her elevated platelet counts.  I will check a ferritin.  This may be difficult to interpret because of inflammation.  If it is decreased, plan will be to add iron supplementation intravenously.  If it is elevated, we could consider a bone marrow biopsy to evaluate her iron stores, and also assess her myelopoiesis given the markedly elevated platelet counts.

She needs continued treatment as you are for her infections.

I will discuss the case with Dr. X as well since there is a question as to whether she might need additional surgery.  She is not a surgical candidate now with her elevated PT/INR.

        CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Agitation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 91-year-old female who was brought in by family.  Apparently, she was complaining that she felt she might have been poisoned at her care facility.  The daughter who accompanied the patient states that she does not think anything is actually wrong, but she became extremely agitated and she thinks that is the biggest problem with the patient right now.  The patient apparently had a little bit of dry heaves, but no actual vomiting.  She had just finished eating dinner.  No one else in the facility has been ill.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for previous abdominal surgeries.  She has a pacemaker.  She has a history of recent collarbone fracture.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Very difficult to get from the patient herself.  She seems to deny any significant pain or discomfort, but really seems not particularly intent on letting me know what is bothering her.  She initially stated that everything was wrong, but could not specify any specific complaints.  Denies chest pain, back pain, or abdominal pain.  Denies any extremity symptoms or complaints.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker.  She is accompanied here with daughter who brought her over here.  They were visiting the patient when this episode occurred.

MEDICATIONS:  Please see list.

ALLERGIES:  NONE.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile, actually has a very normal vital signs including normal pulse oximetry at 99% on room air.  GENERAL:  The patient is an elderly frail looking little lady lying on the gurney.  She is awake, alert, and not really wanted to answer most of the questions I asked her.  She does have a tremor with her mouth, which the daughter states has been there for &quot;many years&quot;.  HEENT:  Eye exam is unremarkable.  Oral mucosa is still moist and well hydrated.  Posterior pharynx is clear.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS:  Actually clear with good breath sounds.  There are no wheezes, no rales, or rhonchi.  Good air movement.  CARDIAC:  Without murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft.  I do not elicit any tenderness.  There is no abdominal distention.  Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants.  SKIN:  Skin is without rash or petechiae.  There is no cyanosis.  EXTREMITIES:  No evidence of any trauma to the extremities.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  I had a long discussion with the family and they would like the patient receive something for agitation, so she was given 0.5 mg of Ativan intramuscularly.  After about half an hour, I came back to talk to the patient and the family, the patient states that she feels better.  Family states she seems more calm.  They do not want to pursue any further workup at this time.

IMPRESSION:  ACUTE EPISODE OF AGITATION.

PLAN:  At this time, I had reviewed the patient's records and it is not particularly enlightening as to what could have triggered off this episode.  The patient herself has good vital signs.  She does not seem to have any specific acute process going on and seemed to feel comfortable after the Ativan was given, a small quantity was given to the patient.  Family and daughter specifically did not want to pursue any workup at this point, which at this point I think is reasonable and we will have her follow up with ABC.  She is discharged in stable condition.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
  Congestion, tactile temperature.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a 21-day-old Caucasian male here for 2 days of congestion - mom has been suctioning yellow discharge from the patient's nares, plus she has noticed some mild problems with his breathing while feeding (but negative for any perioral cyanosis or retractions).  One day ago, mom also noticed a tactile temperature and gave the patient Tylenol.

Baby also has had some decreased p.o. intake.  His normal breast-feeding is down from 20 minutes q.2h. to 5 to 10 minutes secondary to his respiratory congestion.  He sleeps well, but has been more tired and has been fussy over the past 2 days.  The parents noticed no improvement with albuterol treatments given in the ER.  His urine output has also decreased; normally he has 8 to 10 wet and 5 dirty diapers per 24 hours, now he has down to 4 wet diapers per 24 hours.  Mom denies any diarrhea.  His bowel movements are yellow colored and soft in nature.

The parents also noticed no rashes, just his normal neonatal acne.  The parents also deny any vomiting, apnea.


EMERGENCY ROOM COURSE: 
 In the ER, the patient received a lumbar puncture with CSF fluid sent off for culture and cell count.  This tap was reported as clear, then turning bloody in nature.  The patient also received labs including a urinalysis and urine culture, BMP, CBC, CRP, blood culture.  This patient also received as previously noted, 1 albuterol treatment, which did not help his respiratory status.  Finally, the patient received 1 dose of ampicillin and cefotaxime respectively each.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 See above history of present illness.  Mom's nipples are currently cracked and bleeding.  Mom has also noticed some mild umbilical discharge as well as some mild discharge from the penile area.  He is status post a circumcision.  Otherwise, review of systems is negative.


BIRTH/PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 The patient was an 8 pounds 13 ounces' term baby born 1 week early via a planned repeat C-section.  Mom denies any infections during pregnancy, except for thumb and toenail infections, treated with rubbing alcohol (mom denies any history of boils in the family).  GBS status was negative.  Mom smoked up to the last 5 months of the pregnancy.  Mom and dad both deny any sexually transmitted diseases or genital herpetic lesions.  Mom and baby were both discharged out of the hospital last 48 hours.  This patient has received no hospitalizations so far.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
  Circumcision.


ALLERGIES: 
 No known drug allergies.


MEDICATIONS:
  Tylenol.


IMMUNIZATIONS:
  None of the family members this year have received a flu vaccine.


SOCIAL HISTORY:
  At home lives mom, dad, a 2-1/2-year-old brother, and a 5-1/2-year-old maternal stepbrother.  Both brothers at home are sick with cold symptoms including diarrhea and vomiting.  The brother (2-1/2-year-old) was seen in the ER tonight with this patient and discharged home with an albuterol prescription.  A nephew of the mom with an ear infection.  Mom also states that she herself was sick with the flu soon after delivery.  There has been recent travel exposure to dad's family over the Christmas holidays.  At this time, there is also exposure to indoor cats and dogs.  This patient also has positive smoking exposure coming from mom.


FAMILY HISTORY: 
 Paternal grandmother has diabetes and hypertension, paternal grandfather has emphysema and was a smoker.  There are no children needing the use of a pediatric subspecialist or any childhood deaths less than 1 year of age.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  

VITALS:  Temperature max is 99, heart rate was 133 to 177, blood pressure is 114/43 (while moving), respiratory rate was 28 to 56 with O2 saturations 97 to 100% on room air.  Weight was 4.1 kg.
GENERAL:  Not in acute distress, sneezing, positive congestion with breaths taken.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic head.  Anterior fontanelle was soft, open, and flat.  Bilateral red reflexes were positive.  Oropharynx is clear with palate intact, negative rhinorrhea.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper left sternal border, vibratory in nature.  Capillary refill was less than 3 seconds.
LUNGS:  Positive upper airway congestion, transmitted sounds; negative retractions, nasal flaring, or wheezes.
ABDOMEN:  Bowel sounds are positive, nontender, soft, negative hepatosplenomegaly.  Umbilical site was with scant dried yellow discharge.
GU:  Tanner stage 1 male, circumcised.  There was mild hyperemia to the penis with some mild yellow dried discharge.
HIPS:  Negative Barlow or Ortolani maneuvers.
SKIN:  Positive facial erythema toxicum.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 CBC drawn showed a white blood cell count of 14.5 with a differential of 25 segmental cells, 5% bands, 54% lymphocytes.  The hemoglobin was 14.4, hematocrit was 40.  The platelet count was elevated at 698,000.  A CRP was less than 0.3.

A hemolyzed BMP sample showed a sodium of 139, potassium of 5.6, chloride 105, bicarb of 21, and BUN of 4, creatinine 0.4, and a glucose of 66.

A cath urinalysis was negative.

A CSF sample showed 0 white blood cells, 3200 red blood cells (again this was a bloody tap per ER personnel), CSF glucose was 41, CSF protein was 89.  A Gram stain showed rare white blood cells, many red blood cells, no organisms.


ASSESSMENT: 
 A 21-day-old with:
1.  Rule out sepsis.
2.  Possible upper respiratory infection.

Given the patient's multiple sick contacts, he is possibly with a viral upper respiratory infection causing his upper airway congestion plus probable fever.  The bacterial considerations although to consider in this child include group B streptococcus, E. coli, and Listeria.  We should also consider herpes simplex virus, although these 3200 red blood cells from his CSF could be due to his bloody tap in the ER.  Also, there is not a predominant lymphocytosis of his CSF sample (there is 0 white blood cell count in the cell count).

Also to consider in this child is RSV.  The patient though has more congested, nasal breathing more than respiratory distress, for example retractions, desaturations, or accessory muscle use.  Also, there is negative apnea in this patient.


PLAN:  

1.  We will place this patient on the rule out sepsis pathway including IV antibiotics, ampicillin and gentamicin for at least 48 hours.
2.  We will follow up with his blood, urine, and CSF cultures.
3.  I called the lab for the addition of a possible HSV PCR to add to his CSF sample, but there is currently not enough left for this test.  We will not currently start acyclovir considering his bloody tap, but we will pass this information on to the day team for the possible start of this antibiotic.
4.  We will place this patient on IV fluids and wean as his p.o. intake increases.
5.  We will try to supply lanolin cream or cocoa butter for mom's comfort.
6.  We will keep the patient's umbilicus and penis status post circumcision clean with a wet cloth.
7.  We educated mom about the risks of smoking plus the increased incidence of sudden infant death syndrome with children, who are exposed to smoke.
8.  These initial plans were all discussed with mom and dad at the bedside.

After 5 minutes of waiting, then an elliptical incision was made around this mass with electrocautery and then it was sharply dissected off the muscular layer and removed in total.  Suction cautery was used for hemostasis.  Then, 3 simple interrupted #4-0 Vicryl sutures were used to close the wound and procedure was then terminated at that time.

PROCEDURE: 
 Right knee joint steroid injection.


PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Osteoarthritis of the right knee.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Osteoarthritis of the right knee.


PROCEDURE:  
The patient was apprised of the risks and the benefits of the procedure and consented.  The patient's right knee was sterilely prepped with Betadine.  A 4 mg of dexamethasone was drawn up into a 5 mL syringe with a 3 mL of 1% lidocaine.  The patient was injected with a 1.5-inch 25-gauze needle at the medial aspect of his right flexed knee.  There were no complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There was minimal bleeding.  The patient was instructed to ice his knee upon leaving clinic and refrain from overuse over the next 3 days.  The patient was instructed to go to the emergency room with any usual pain, swelling, or redness occurred in the injected area.  The patient was given a followup appointment to evaluate response to the injection to his increased range of motion and reduction of pain.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 Newly diagnosed T-cell lymphoma.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a very pleasant 40-year-old gentleman who reports swelling in his left submandibular region that occurred all of a sudden about a month and a half ago.  He was originally treated with antibiotics as a possible tooth abscess.  Prior to this event, in March of 2010, he was treated for strep throat.  The pain at that time was on the right side.  About a month ago, he started having night sweats.  The patient reports feeling hot, when he went to bed he fall asleep and would wake up soaked.  All these symptoms were preceded by overwhelming fatigue and exhaustion.  He reports being under significant amount of stress as he and his mom just recently moved from their house to a mobile home.  With the fatigue, he has had some mild chest pain and shortness of breath, and has also noted a decrease in his appetite, although he reports his weight has been stable.  He also reports occasional headaches with some stabbing and pain in his feet and legs.  He also complains of some left groin pain.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Significant for HIV diagnosed in 2000.  He also had mononucleosis at that time.  The patient reports being on anti-hepatitis viral therapy period that was very intense.  He took the meds for about six months, he reports stopping, and prior to 2002 at one point during his treatment, he was profoundly weak and found to have hemoglobin less than 4 and required three units of packed red blood cells.  He reports no other history of transfusions.  He has history of spontaneous pneumothorax.  The first episode was 1989 on his right lung.  In 1990 he had a slow collapse of the left lung.  He reports no other history of pneumothoraces.  In 2003, he had shingles.  He went through antiviral treatment at that time and he also reports another small outbreak in 2009 that he treated with topical therapy.


FAMILY HISTORY: 
 Notable for his mother who is currently battling non-small cell lung cancer.  She is a nonsmoker.  His sister is Epstein-Barr virus positive.  The patient's mother also reports that she is Epstein-Barr virus positive.  His maternal grandfather died from complications from melanoma.  His mother also has diabetes.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 The patient is single.  He currently lives with his mother in house for several both in New York and here in Colorado.  His mother moved out to Colorado eight years ago and he has been out here for seven years.  He currently is self employed and does antiquing.  He has also worked as nurses' aide and worked in group home for the state of New York for the developmentally delayed.  He is homosexual, currently not sexually active.  He does have smoking history as about a thirteen and a half pack year history of smoking, currently smoking about a quarter of a pack per day.  He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 As mentioned above his weight has been fairly stable.  Although, he suffered from obesity as a young teenager, but through a period of anorexia, but his weight has been stable now for about 20 years.  He has had night sweats, chest pain, and is also suffering from some depression as well as overwhelming fatigue, stabbing, short-lived headaches and occasional shortness of breath.  He has noted some stool irregularity with occasional loose stools and new onset of pain predominantly in left neck.  He has had fevers as well.  The rest of his review of systems is negative.


PHYSICAL EXAM:

VITALS:    BP:  100/64.  HEART RATE:  72.  TEMP:  97.  Weight:   61.4 kg.
GEN:      He is a very pleasant gentleman, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  He has obvious mass in submandibular region on the left.  His pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  He has a nevus just below his orbit on the right hand side that has some irregularity.  His pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Sclerae anicteric.  His oropharynx is clear.  He has several missing teeth.
NECK:  Supple.  He has large palpable mass in the submandibular region and firm.  He has some shotty lymphadenopathy in the posterior cervical chain bilaterally.
LUNGS:    Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV:  Regular rate, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN:    Soft.  He has positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  He has shotty axillary adenopathy and shotty inguinal adenopathy.
EXT:      Lower extremity is without edema.

His CT scan of the chest showed prominent axillary lymph nodes bilaterally, largest on the left measuring 12 x 29 mm.  He has borderline enlarge right superior hilar lymph node measuring 9 x 11 mm.  His lungs are benign appearing by apical pleural parenchymal scarring and very mild peri-septal emphysema.  Bones shows mild disk degenerative changes in the inferior thoracic spine.


IMPRESSION: 

1.  Borderline enlarged right superior hilar and left axillary lymph nodes, otherwise it unremarkable CT of the chest.  CT of the neck shows 4.1 x 3.0 x 3.9 cm heterogenously enhancing lesion in the left submandibular space with central necrosis.  The lesion appears to be separate from the submandibular gland with displacement of the glands superiorly and posteriorly.  This lesion is most suspicious for an enlarged lymph node.  Also, numerous other enlarged enhancing lymph nodes in the anterior and posterior cervical chains and left supraclavicular region.
2.  Prominent palatine tonsils and lingular tonsillar tissue bilaterally which may be reactive or could indicate lymphomatous involvement if the patient does have lymphoma.
3.  Rim-enhancing lesions in the right parotid gland.  These could be Warthin tumors or potentially necrotic intraparotid lymph nodes related to the previously described process in the neck.  Pathology for fine needle aspiration of the left mandible shows an atypical cell population, the atypical cell population is difficult to define.  A neoplastic process is favored.  While they are fairly large, they are still within the realm of being lymphoid in nature, and they are also discohesive, which also favours of lymphoid neoplasm.  He then had a biopsy of the right maxillary alveolar ridge.  This was positive for high grade lymphoma most consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.


ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  
This is a very pleasant 40-year-old gentleman with certain onset of swelling in his left neck, biopsies consistent with T-cell lymphoma.  I plan at this point time is to complete the staging.  He will check HTLV-1 serology.  We will also send pro for blood for flow cytometry and analysis for atypical cells.  We will obtain a CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel and LDH.  We will also send his stool for parasites and obtain a PET CT scan.  We were to preliminarily stage this he is at least stage 2 lymph nodes in the neck and the axilla seen on skin.  On physical exam lymph nodes are palpable in inguinal region.  He does have these symptoms with the drenching night sweats and fever.  We will also check viral load and hepatitis B and C panel.  The patient has not established care with infectious disease physician.  We will need to reformed ID as if he true he has HIV positive, we can do some help in coordinating HIV treatment as well as treatment for what appears to be a T-cell lymphoma.  Once we get these preliminary labs back then we will discuss the need for bone marrow biopsy and lumbar puncture.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Same.


PROCEDURE:

1.  Stellate ganglion RFTC (radiofrequency thermocoagulation)  left side.
2.  Interpretation of Radiograph.


ANESTHESIA:  
IV Sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.


ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
  None.


COMPLICATIONS:
  None.


INDICATIONS: 
 Patient with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, left side.  Positive for allodynia, pain, mottled appearance, skin changes upper extremities as well as swelling.


SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: 
 Patient is admitted to the Operating Room.  Monitors placed, including EKG, Pulse oximeter, and BP cuff.  Patient had a pillow placed under the shoulder blades.  The head and neck was allowed to fall back into hyperextension.  The neck region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and alcohol.  Four sterile towels were placed.  The cricothyroid membrane was palpated, then going one finger's breadth lateral from the cricothyroid membrane and one finger's breadth inferior, the carotid pulse was palpated and the sheath was retracted laterally.  A 22 gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle was then introduced in between the cricothyroid membrane and the carotid sheath and directed inferiomedially.  The needle is advanced prudently through the tissues, avoiding the carotid artery laterally.  The tip of the needle is perceived to intersect with the vertebral body of Cervical #7 and this was visualized by fluoroscopy.  Aspiration was cautiously performed after the needle was retracted approximately 1 mm and held steady with left hand.  No venous or arterial blood return is noted.  No cerebral spinal fluid is noted.  Positive sensory stimulation was elicited using the Radionics unit at 50 Hz from 0-0.1 volts and negative motor stimulation was elicited from 1-10 volts at 2 Hz.  After negative aspiration through the 22 gauge SMK 5mm bare tipped needle is absolutely confirmed, 5 cc of solution (solution consisting of 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine, 1 cc of triamcinolone) was then injected into the stellate ganglion region.  This was done with intermittent aspiration vigilantly verifying negative aspiration.  The stylet was then promptly replaced and neurolysis (nerve decompression) was then carried out for 60 seconds at 80 degrees centigrade.  This exact same procedure using the exact same protocol was repeated one more time to complete the two lesions of the stellate ganglion.  The patient was immediately placed in the sitting position to reduce any side effect from the stellate ganglion block associated with cephalad spread of the solution.  Pressure was placed over the puncture site for approximately five minutes to eliminate any hemorrhage from blood vessels that may have been punctured and a Band-Aid was placed over the puncture site.  Patient was monitored for an additional ten to fifteen minutes and was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any adverse sequelae.  Significant temperature elevation was noted on the affected side verifying neurolysis of the ganglion.  

Interpretation of radiograph reveals placement of the 22-gauge SMK 5-mm bare tipped needle in the region of the stellate ganglion on the affected side.  Four lesions were carried out.

COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL STATUS EVALUATION



REASON FOR REFERRAL/GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:
  The patient was referred for a Comprehensive Mental Status Evaluation for the purpose of assisting in the determination of eligibility for Disability.  He is a 43-year-old married, white male who came unaccompanied to the evaluation.  He drove himself suggesting that he drives regularly.  He reportedly has been on Disability since around 2002.  He was a good historian, freely offering information.  He was dressed and groomed casually, yet neat and appropriate in appearance.  He was cooperative with all questions presented and the information collected is felt to be a reliable indication of current functioning.  No censorship of data was indicated.  


PRESENT PROBLEMS:
  The claimant described his recent problems as, &quot;serious depression.  Very hard to concentrate.  Very short tempered.  Usually distracted.&quot; 

The claimant reportedly has had significant problems with depression since around 1997.

The claimant last worked about six weeks ago.  He was drafting at a company in Stanfield, North Carolina, for almost six months and was laid off because &quot;I had a breakdown and ended up in the hospital.  They said that I wasn't reliable enough and laid me off.&quot;  Prior to that he worked for two and a half months doing drafting at another company and was laid off because he was no longer needed.  

The claimant has had significant emotional problems since around 1997.  He was first hospitalized in that year and has been hospitalized five more times since then.  The last hospitalization was last month in Atlanta, Georgia.  He has tried to overdose in the past as well as cut his wrist.  He even had to undergo electroconvulsive therapy in 2001, because of depression.  He also, supposedly, has a history of sexual assault towards a minor and his on probation for that incident.  Details regarding this episode of child sexual assault were not forthcoming.

The claimant now takes Effexor 75 mg b.i.d.  He is not involved in outpatient therapy.  


PERSONAL, FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:
  The claimant indicated that he graduated from high school in regular classes.  He did have to repeat the kindergarten because he was too young.  He worked for about 10 years at a company in Massachusetts.  He was not advancing on that job and therefore quit.  He has had three subsequent jobs and a number of emotional problems since.  He indicated usually getting along with others but stated, &quot;I had trouble taking direction from someone younger than me.  I resent getting nagged at.  I'd get angry or just seethe.&quot;  He has been let go from his last two jobs because of emotional issues.  

The claimant was married the first time for five years.  He has no children.  He now lives at home with his wife.
 
The claimant denied any legal problems.  He suggested that his mother had bipolar disorder.  He has never served in the military.

The claimant denied the use or abuse of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs.  He stopped drinking in 1997.  Prior to that he drank about a six pack of beer per day for about 15 years.

The claimant takes the no other prescribed medications.
 

DAILY ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONING:
  The claimant described his typical day as follows, &quot;I usually get up about 7:00 to 7:30.  Have breakfast.  Take a shower about 8:30.  Do errands.  Me and my wife are out of the house by 9:00.  Check e-mail at the library.  I like the computer.  We have lunch 11:30 or 12:00.  Do errands or watch talk shows or I'll read.  I love to read.  Around 5:00 to 5:30, have supper.  Watch the news, game shows.  In bed by 10:00.&quot;  He will help with vacuuming, doing the dishes or yard work.  His wife does most of the house cleaning.  He does no cooking.  He and his wife get out every day usually for three or four hours.  He has a neighbor next door that he will see twice a week.  He used to go to the gym but has not been in a few weeks.  No other family contact was described and he does not go to church.  When asked what he enjoys he stated, &quot;read, use my computer or go ride my bike.&quot;
 

MENTAL STATUS EVALUATION:
  On interview, the claimant looked his stated age of 43 years.  He was tall in stature and thin in weight.  He was neat and clean in appearance.  Posture was somewhat tense but psychomotor activity was not remarkable.  Eye contact was fleeting with fair social skills evident.  Facial expression was tense and affect was restricted with little animation noted.  General mood appeared dysphoric.  Speech was clear, coherent, logical, goal-directed and relevant.  He was cooperative in attitude toward the examiner.  He described his recent mood as, &quot;cloudy, gray because we've got a lot of personal problems right now.  I'm frustrated because I don't know where things are going.&quot;  He described some problems with falling asleep and staying asleep at night as well as decreased energy level.  He denied appetite disturbance.  He has lost interest in some activities suggesting mild anhedonia.  He has trouble with attention and concentration stating, &quot;I have trouble recalling how to do things on the computer. I've always been technically minded, but now it's harder.&quot;  He has thoughts of suicide about once or twice a week and has often fled situations in the past.  He stated, &quot;I try to keep myself from running away.&quot;  He denied any plan or intent for suicide.  He suggested significant anxiety problems as well.  He stated, &quot;I'm dealing with pedophilia.  I try to time it so that I don't go to a store with lots of people around.  If there is people I get real edgy, heart pounds, shortness of breath.  A lot of chest discomfort.&quot;  He has these panic symptoms quite regularly and they have occurred ever since 1997.  That was the time that he engaged in some type of sexual assault with a minor and spent about a week in jail.  No phobic processes were suggested.  No psychotic symptoms were revealed.  He denied hallucinations and no delusional material was elicited.  Thought content was appropriate to mood and circumstances.

The claimant was oriented in all spheres.  He evidenced adequate memory for both recent and remote events.  He was able to recall 3 of 3 words after a 1 minute and 10 minute delay.  Fair sustained attention and concentration skills were shown.  He was able to spell a word backward and performed a serial 7 subtraction task affectively.  Basic calculation skills were intact and no language-based dysfunction was noted.  Social judgment was also intact as he gave a good response to finding a wallet in the street, &quot;find who the owner was, bring it to the police station or contact the person,&quot; and to seeing smoke in a theater, &quot;Get a hold of staff so they could evacuate.&quot;  Adequate conceptual abilities was shown with similarity comparisons.  Somewhat limited abstraction was shown with proverb interpretation, glass houses, &quot;don't do anything you're not supposed to do.&quot;  Premorbid intellect is estimated to be at least in the average range.  Insight regarding his situation was fair.


DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:

Axis I:  Major Depression, recurrent, moderate.  Panic disorder without agoraphobia.


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS:
  Based on this evaluation, I believe the claimant's current condition would continue to result in difficulty with work-related activities.  He continues to show significant problems with depression and anxiety.  He is quite withdrawn and socially isolated and has panic attacks whenever he is confronted with public situations.  He relies on his wife to take care of most all household task.  He engages in very few simple, routine and repetitive activities. Cognitive capacity was relatively intact suggesting no significant problems in maintaining focus and pace with task.


RECOMMENDATIONS/CAPABILITY:
  The claimant was strongly encouraged to get some additional help for his emotional problems.  He would benefit from having someone to speak with on a regular basis and some referrals were offered. 

It is the opinion of this examiner that the claimant is capable of handling his own funds if so assigned.

IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENT: 
 ABCD is an 8-year-old Hispanic male currently in the second grade.


CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 ABCD presents to this visit with his mother, Xyz, and her significant other, Pqr.  Circumstances leading to this admission:  In the past, ABCD has been diagnosed and treated for ADHD, combined type, and has been on Concerta 54 mg one p.o. q.8h.  Since he has been on the 54 mg, mother has concerns because he has not been sleeping well at night, consistently he is staying up until 12:00 or 1:00, and he is not eating the noonday meal and not that much for supper.  ABCD is also complaining of headaches when he takes the medication.  Mother reports that on the weekends he is off the medication.  She does notice that his sisters become more irritated with him and say he is either hitting them or bothering them and he will say, &quot;It's an accident.&quot;  She sees him as impulsive on the weekends, but is not sure if this just isn't &quot;all boy.&quot;

Mother reports ABCD has been on medication since kindergarten.  Currently, the teachers say he is able to pay attention and he is well behaved in school.  Prior to being on medication, there were issues with the teachers saying he was distractible and had difficulty paying attention.

He had a psychological evaluation done on 07/16/06 by Dr. X, in which he was diagnosed with ADHD, combined type; ODD; rule out depressive disorder, NOS; rule out adjustment disorder with depressed mood; and rule out adjustment disorder with mixed features of conduct.  He also has seen XYZ, LCSW, in the past for outpatient therapy.

ABCD's mother, A, as well as her significant other, R, and his teachers are not convinced that he needs his medication and would like to either trial him off or trial him on a lower dose.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

Sleep:  As stated before, he is having much difficulty on a consistent basis falling asleep.  It is 12:00 to 1:00 a.m. before he falls to sleep.  When he was on the 36 mg of Concerta, he was able to fall asleep without difficulty.  On the weekends, he is also having difficulty falling asleep, even though he is not taking the medication.
Appetite:  He will eat breakfast and supper, but not much lunch, if any at all.  He has not lost weight that mother is aware of, nor is he getting more sick than normal.
Mood control:  Mother reports he has not been aggressive since he has been on the medication, nor is he getting in trouble at school for aggression or misbehavior.  The only exception to this is he gets in occasional fights with his sisters.  ABCD denies visual or auditory hallucinations or racing thoughts.  He reports his thoughts are sometimes bad because he says sometimes he thinks of the &quot;S&quot; word.
Energy:  Mother reports a lot of energy.
Pain:  ABCD denies any pain in his body.
Suicidal or homicidal thoughts:  He denies suicidal thoughts or plan to hurt himself or anyone else.


PAST TREATMENT AND/OR MEDICATIONS:

ABCD was originally tried on Ritalin in kindergarten, and he has been on Concerta since 07/14/06.  He has received outpatient therapy from XYZ, LCSW.  He is currently not in outpatient therapy.


FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:

Mother reports that on her side of the family she is currently being assessed for mood disorder/bipolar.

TALENTS AND GIFTS:
  He is good at basketball, video games, and reading books.


MENTAL STATUS EXAM:
  This was a very long appointment, approximately two hours in length, due to mother and significant other had many questions.  ABCD kept himself occupied throughout and was very well behaved throughout the session.  He had some significant memory responses in that he remembered the last holiday was Martin Luther King Day, which is somewhat unusual for a child his age, but he could only recall one of three items after five minutes.  Distractibility and attention:  He, at times, was very mildly distracted, but otherwise did not appear hyperactive.  His judgment was adequate.  When asked what he would do if there was a fire in his house, he said, &quot;Get out!&quot;  Insight was poor to adequate.  Fund of information was good.  When asked who the president was, he said, &quot;George Washington.&quot; Intelligence is probably average to above average.  Speech was normal.  He had some difficulty with abstract thinking.  He could not see any similarities between an orange and an apple, but was able to see similarities of wheels between an airplane and a bicycle.  On serial 7's he could do 100 minus 7, but then unable to subtract any of the others, but he completed serial 3's very rapidly.  When given three commands in a row, he used his left hand instead of his right hand, but followed the last two commands correctly.  Appearance was casual.  Hygiene was good.  Attitude was cooperative.  Speech was normal.  Psychomotor was between normal and slightly hyperactive.  Orientation was x2.  Attention/concentration was intact.  Memory was intact at times and then had some memory recall problems with three words.  Mood was euthymic.  Affect was bright.  He has no suicidal or homicidal/violence risks.  Perceptions were normal.  Thought process logical.  Thought content normal.  Disassociation none.  Sleep:  He is having some insomnia.  Appetite/eating are decreased.


STRENGTHS AND SUPPORTS:
  He has a strong support system in his mother, grandmother, and mother's significant other, Richard.  He has good health.  He has shown gain from past treatment.  He has a sense of humor and a positive relationship with his mother and her significant other, as well as good school behavior.


CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
  It is difficult to know until he is trialed off medication whether or not he truly has attention deficit or oppositional behavior, due to mother has since the last appointment created a lot of structure in her life.  She has implemented some parenting techniques, Love and Logic by Foster Cline and 1-2-3 Magic by Dr. P, in which she is carrying out pretty consistently and it seems that ABCD is doing much better with his behavior since she has instituted these.  He is also doing well in school, but he is on medication when he is in school.  The medication is causing him some distress in that he is not sleeping at night.  He could have an underlying mood disorder and that is what is manifesting with the insomnia, due to he does not receive the medication on the weekends and still has problems going to sleep.  There is a possibility ABCD could have an underlying mood disorder with mother being assessed for bipolar and due to the history of father's risk-taking behaviors, drug and alcohol use, as well as impulsivity.  Also mother reports that if things get too noisy or too chaotic around ABCD, he will report that his head hurts or that he feels there is too much going into his head.


DIAGNOSES:


AXIS  I
  At this point in time we are in an investigative time, so will give:  312.9  Disruptive behavior disorder, NOS (not otherwise specified).  314.01 ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), combined, by history.  Rule out mood disorder.

AXIS  II
  None.

AXIS III
  None.

AXIS IV
  Problems with primary support group.

AXIS V
  GAF:  65, current.


PROGNOSIS:

Good, due to mother and significant other are very invested in ABCD's care.


PLAN: 
 Trial off the Concerta.  I gave mother the NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Scales that
screen for ADHD, as well as anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, depression, and mood.  We will have mother and Richard, as well as teachers, screen him on medication and off medication.  Encouraged mother to continue with the Love and Logic and 1-2-3 Magic parenting techniques.

Follow up will be in three weeks.  The parents were given the option that they may cancel the appointment if he his stable off medication.  If he has difficulty being off medication, before any more prescriptions will be written, we would want to see the assessments from the NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Scales.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, right upper extremity.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Same.


OPERATION:
      Stellate ganglion block.


ANESTHESIA:
      Local and sedation.


COMPLICATIONS:
      None.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
  The procedure risks and hazards were discussed with the patient and a proper consent was obtained.  The patient was monitored by appropriately and then placed in a supine position on a fluoroscopy table with a shoulder roll in place with the cervical spine in a slightly extended position, as much as tolerated.  The affected side was prepped with antiseptic solution and draped in a sterile classical fashion.

The cricoid cartilage is palpated and the fingertips are moved laterally, displacing the sternocleidomastoid and the carotid sheath laterally.  Chassaignac's tubercle, the transverse process of the 6th cervical vertebra, is identified under fluoroscopic control palpated and then isolated between two palpating fingertips.  Once the carotid sheath is out of the way, a 22-gauge needle is inserted perpendicularly to all planes and placed on the anterior lateral border of the C-6 vertebral body and then withdrawn 1-2 millimeters before a negative aspiration is performed for heme and CSF.  Three to five milliliters of nonionic radio-opaque contrast media is injected and noted to flow over the lateral borders of the ipsilateral cervical vertebral bodies.  This is followed by an injection of 10cc of Marcaine 0.25% in aliquots of 2 cc with negative aspirations between injections.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without any evidence of complications or problems.  They were experiencing evidence of a Horner's sign after the block was established.  They were experiencing relief from their pain after the block had set.

DIAGNOSIS:
  Polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis.


REASON FOR VISIT:
 Followup of the above condition.


CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 Left shin pain.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 A 55-year-old white male who carries a diagnosis of polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis.  Diagnosis was made some time in 2005/2006.  Initially, he underwent phlebotomy.  He subsequently transferred his care here.  In the past, he has been on hydroxyurea and interferon but did not tolerate both of them.  He is JAK-2 positive.  He does not have any siblings for a match-related transplant.  He was seen for consideration of a MUD transplant, but was deemed not to be a candidate because of the social support as well as his reasonably good health.

At our institution, the patient received a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for a short period.  He did well with the combination.  Subsequently, he developed intolerance to lenalidomide.  He complained of severe fatigue and diarrhea.  This was subsequently stopped.

The patient reports some injury to his left leg last week.  His left leg apparently was swollen.  He took steroids for about 3 days and stopped.  Left leg swelling has disappeared.  The patient denies any other complaints at this point in time.  He admits to smoking marijuana.  He says this gives him a great appetite and he has actually gained some weight.  Performance status in the ECOG scale is 1.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

VITAL SIGNS:  He is afebrile.  Blood pressure 144/85, pulse 86, weight 61.8 kg, and respiratory rate 18 per minute.  GENERAL:  He is in no acute distress.  HEENT:  There is no pallor, icterus or cervical adenopathy that is noted.  Oral cavity is normal to exam.  CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 normal with regular rate and rhythm.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no hepatomegaly.  Spleen is palpable 4 fingerbreadths below the left costal margin.  There is no guarding, tenderness, rebound or rigidity noted.  Bowel sounds are present.  EXTREMITIES:  Reveal no edema.  Palpation of the left tibia revealed some mild tenderness.  However, I do not palpate any bony abnormalities.  There is no history of deep venous thrombosis.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 CBC from today is significant for a white count of 41,900 with an absolute neutrophil count of 34,400, hemoglobin 14.8 with an MCV of 56.7, and platelet count 235,000.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  JAK-2 positive myeloproliferative disorder.  The patient has failed pretty much all available options.  He is not a candidate for chlorambucil or radioactive phosphorus because of his young age and the concern for secondary malignancy.  I have e-mailed Dr. X to see whether he will be a candidate for the LBH trial.  Hopefully, we can get a JAK-2 inhibitor trial quickly on board.
2.  I am concerned about the risk of thrombosis with his elevated white count.  He is on aspirin prophylaxis.  The patient has been told to call me with any complaints.
3.  Left shin pain.  I have ordered x-rays of the left tibia and knee today.  The patient will return to the clinic in 3 weeks.  He is to call me in the interim for any problems.

REASON FOR REFERRAL:  
The patient was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess neuropsychological factors, clarify areas of strength and weakness, and to assist in therapeutic program planning in light of episodes of syncope.


BRIEF SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:



RELEVANT HISTORY:

Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and an interview with 
the patient.

The patient presented to Dr. X on August 05, 2008 as she had been recently hospitalized for prolonged episodes of syncope.  She was referred to Dr. X for diagnostic differentiation for possible seizures or other causes of syncope.  The patient reports an extensive neurological history.  Her mother used alcohol during her pregnancy with the patient.  In spite of exposure to alcohol in utero, the patient reported that she achieved &quot;honors in school&quot; and &quot;looked smart.&quot;  She reported that she began to experience migraines at 11 years of age.  At 15 years of age, she reported that she was thought to have hydrocephalus.  She reported that she will frequently &quot;bang her head against the wall&quot; to relieve the pain.  The patient gave birth to her daughter at 17 years of age.  At 18 years of age, she received a spinal tap as a procedure to determine the cause of her severe headaches.  She reported, in 1995 to 1996 she experienced a severe head injury, as she was struck by a car as a pedestrian and &quot;thrown two and a half city blocks.&quot;  The patient reported that she could recall before being hit, but could not recall the activities of that same day or the following day.  She reported that she had difficulty walking following this head injury, but received rehabilitation for approximately one month.  Her migraines became more severe following the head injury.  In 1998, she reportedly was experiencing episodes of syncope where she would experience a headache with photophobia, phonophobia, and flashing lights.  Following the syncope episode, she would experience some confusion.  These episodes reportedly were related to her donating plasma.

The patient also reported that her ex-husband stated that she frequently jerked and would shake in her sleep.  She reported that upon awakening, she would feel off balanced and somewhat confused.  These episodes diminished from 2002 to June 2008.  When making dinner, she suddenly dropped and hit the back of her head on refrigerator.  She reported that she was unconscious for five to six minutes.  A second episode occurred on July 20th when she lost consciousness for may be a full day.  She was admitted to Sinai Hospital and assessed by a neurologist.  Her EEG and head CT were considered to be completely normal.  She did not report any typical episodes during the time of her 36-hour EEG.  She reported that her last episode of syncope occurred prior to her being hospitalized.  She stated that she had an aura of her ears ringing, vision being darker and &quot;tunnel vision&quot; (vision goes smaller to a pinpoint), and she was &quot;spazzing out&quot; on the floor.  During these episodes, she reports that she cannot talk and has difficulty understanding.

The patient also reports that she has experienced some insomnia since she was 6 years old.  She reported that she was a heavy drinker until about 1998 or 1999 and that she would drink a gallon daily of Jack Daniel.  She stopped the use of alcohol and that time she experienced a suicide attempt.  In 2002, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on medication.  At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, she had stopped taking her medicine as she felt that she was now in remission and could manage her symptoms herself.  The patient's medical history is also significant for postpartum depression.

The patient reported that she has been experiencing difficulty with cognitive abilities of attention/concentration, spelling, tangential and slow thinking, poor sequencing memory for events, and variable verbal memory.  She reported that she sometimes has difficulty understanding what people say, specifically she has difficulty understanding jokes.  She finds that she often has difficulty with expressing her thoughts, as she is very tangential.  She experiences episodes of not recalling what she was speaking of or remembering what activities she was trying to perform.  She reported that she had a photographic memory for directions.  She said that she experienced a great deal of emotional lability, but in general her personality has become more subdued.  At the present time, her daughter has now moved on to college.  The patient is living with her biological mother.  Although she is going through divorce, she reported that it was not really stressful.  She reported that she spends her day driving other people around and trying to be helpful to them.

At the time of the neuropsychological evaluation, the patient's medication included Ativan, Imitrex, Levoxyl, vitamin B12, albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed, and Zofran as needed.  (It should be noted that The patient by the time of the feedback on September 19, 2008 had resumed taking her Trileptal for bipolar disorder.).  The patient's familial medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.

BEHAVIOR OBSERVATIONS:  
The patient presented as a well-dressed and African-American woman who developed a rapport with the examiner.  She appeared somewhat anxious and started the evaluation on the edge of her chair, although she eventually tended to relax more.  Overall, her affect and mood were appropriate for the evaluation.  Her speech was slightly above normal for rate, speed, and intensity.  She was slightly tangential.  She appeared to have no difficulty comprehending or expressing herself.  Her performance was notable for poor cognitive flexibility and impulsivity.  She also demonstrated mild psychomotor slowing.  The patient was right-handed for writing and drawing.  Overall, she demonstrated adequate rates of attention/concentration, cooperation, and perseverance.  Therefore, the following evaluation is considered to be an accurate reflection of her current cognitive abilities.

ORIENTATION: 
 The patient was oriented to person, place, and time.


GENERAL COGNITIVE ABILITY: 
 The patient's overall intellectual ability fell in the average range.  There was no statistically significant discrepancy between her verbal and her performance (nonverbal) intellect.


ATTENTION/ EXECUTIVE FUNCTION:
  The patient did well on measures of verbal and design fluency as her performance fell in the average range.  On a trial making task, she did well on all versions of the test including number, letter sequencing with the exception of the motor speed task.  On this measure, she did not listen fully to the instructions and reduced her speed.  On a color word interference task, her performance for inhibiting responses fell in low average range and was a subtle change from her high end of average performance on color naming and word reading.  On measures of visual and verbal working memory, her performance was solidly in the average range.

The patient completed a valid Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning.  On this measure, she indicated that she was experiencing difficulties with cognitive inflexibility, emotional dyscontrol, and poor working memory.


LANGUAGE FUNCTION:
  The patient had a difficulty with measures that are related more to verbal comprehension.  She had significant difficulty with repeating sentences and difficulty with following commands.  On the command comprehension measure, she had difficulty with sequencing and two-step commands.  On sentence repetition, she had difficulty remembering the details of the sentence that she repeated.  On a naming to command measure, her performance fell in the average range and on the verbal fluency measure both semantic and phonemic, her performance fell in the average range.  Overall, this pattern of performance suggests mild receptive language difficulties and difficulty with sequencing.


VISUAL-SPATIAL & VISUAL-MOTOR FUNCTION: 
 On a visual spatial discrimination task, her performance fell solidly in the average range.  On a measure of fine motor manual dexterity, her right hand and left hand performance fell in the average range and when she was required to use both hands simultaneously, her performance decreased slightly into the low average range.


LEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS:
  On a five-trial 16-item verbal list learning measure, the patient's rate of acquisition fell in the high average range.  When a interference list was introduced, she had some difficulty learning the interference list as she could only recall 25% of the words.  However, following the introduction of this list, she was still able to recall 15 of the 16 words from the original list.  Following a 20-minute delay, she was able to recall 15 of the 16 words.  She entirely used a semantic cluster strategy.  Overall, her performance fell in the high average range on this measure.  On a story (prose) verbal memory measure, her immediate and delayed (30 minute) recall both fell in the high average range.
 
On the copy of the complex geometric design, her visual spatial organization was poor and her performance fell in the low average range.  Her immediate recall of the design fell in the borderline range and following a 30-minute delay, she lost even more details to decline into the mildly impaired range.  In general, her copy of the design was notable for its lack of overall configuration and good stop.  Her immediate recall failed to maintain a good stop overall configuration design and was void of details.  The design further decompensated after a 30-minute delay as she lost further configuration and details.  It is thought that her poor performance on this could represent some difficulty in visual memory, but most likely is due to poor initial encoding and organization of the design.  On facial recognition task, her immediate recognition of the faces fell in the high average range.  Following a 30-minute delay, though her performance declined to the low end of average, this is a significant discrepancy and suggested that she did have difficulty retaining and retrieving the information that she had stored.  Therefore, a subtle mild weakness is in visual spatial memory.


ACADEMIC FUNCTION:



BEHAVIORAL/EMOTIONAL FUNCTION:
  The patient was administered a MMPI-2.  Her responses unfortunately were completely invalid due to an over endorsement of symptoms.  Typically, an over endorsement of symptoms is indicative of significant affective distress or a need for attention.  On this measure, 
The patient reported an elevated level of affective distress and unusual ideation.  Her profile is consistent with patients who may demonstrate their affective distress through physical means.  Overall, this pattern should be interpreted very cautiously due to the invalid nature of the profile.


SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS:
  The patient was referred by neurologist for a neuropsychological evaluation for diagnostic clarity, and specific recommendations for medical and psychological intervention in light of undiagnosed episodes of syncope.

In summary, the patient's neuropsychological evaluation revealed selective deficits of executive system dysfunction, mild receptive language difficulties (partially due to executive system dysfunction) and subtle visual memory storage and retrieval superimposed upon an average level of intellect.  Her MMPI-2 was invalid, but indicated that she was undergoing significant stress and that she is more likely to demonstrate her stress through physical and cognitive rather than emotional display.

The patient's neurobehavioral risk factors are significant for chronic history of migraines, bipolar disorder, depression, reported in utero exposure to alcohol, history of heavy substance abuse, and use of neuropsychiatric medication.  Bipolar affective disorder is known to impact executive system dysfunction as patients have difficulty with impulsivity, cognitive flexibility, working memory, emotional control, and self-monitoring.  The patient's performance is certainly consistent with this report.  Medication can also have an effect on executive system functioning and attention/concentration.  Despite this, it is far better for her to have access to neuropsychiatric medication to balance her mood swings.  There was some mild evidence of decreased visual spatial memory for retrieval in contrast to high average verbal memory.  Although she had difficulty on measures of comprehension, it was likely due to decreased attention and concentration given that she was able to perform other tasks that require receptive language very well (verbal memory).  Given The patient's history, she has done extraordinarily well and many of her cognitive abilities are intact, which allow her to function at a very high level.  It is strongly recommended that she share these results with her psychiatrist/psychologist to assist in any treatment planning for her and to continue to make positive and achievable goals for The patient.
 
You may wish to consider the following recommendations to improve The patient's quality of life.


RECOMMENDATIONS:


MEDICAL:

1.  Please share these results with Dr. X to determine any need to change in her medical treatment.
2.  It is critical that the patient take care of herself and reduce her distress.  In particular, she should make sure that she has a normalized sleeping pattern and she is eating appropriately and getting appropriate rest.
Psychological:
1.  She should share these results with her psychiatrist/psychologist, to assess for any change in her current psychological treatment.
2.  It is likely that the patient will need to stay on medication to treat her bipolar disorder.  Bipolar disorder does not go into remission and sadly is a chronic disorder.
3.  In psychotherapy, it is important for goals to be set for the patient and that she can achieve those goals.  It is apparent that she is frequently feeling overwhelmed and does not understand how to be able to take care of herself and ways that are not needing medical care.  Goals to increase her sleep and reduce her stress may be fundamental, but are certainly required in her case.


OCCUPATIONAL: 
 The patient has many strong abilities and with balance of her emotional life, there is no reason why she cannot return to work.  Her work setting should be in a well structured place with minimal multitasking and will keep a people contact.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
  Questionable foreign body, right nose.  Belly and back pain.  


SUBJECTIVE: 
 Mr. ABC is a 2-year-old boy, who is brought in by parents, stating that the child keeps complaining of belly and back pain.  This does not seem to be slowing him down.  They have not noticed any change in his urine or bowels.  They have not noted him to have any fevers or chills or any other illness.  They state he is otherwise acting normally.  He is eating and drinking well.  He has not had any other acute complaints, although they have noted a foul odor coming from his nose.  Apparently, he was seen here a few weeks ago for a foreign body in the right nose, which was apparently a piece of cotton; this was removed and placed on antibiotics.  His nose got better and then started to become malodorous again.  Mother restarted him on the remainder of the antibiotics and they are also stating that they think there is something still in there.  Otherwise, he has not had any runny nose, earache, no sore throat.  He has not had any cough, congestion.  He has been acting normally.  Eating and drinking okay.  No other significant complaints.  He has not had any pain with bowel movement or urination, nor have they noted him to be more frequently urinating, then again he is still on a diaper.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Otherwise negative.


ALLERGIES: 
 No allergies.


MEDICATIONS: 
 No medications other than recent amoxicillin.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 Parents do smoke around the house.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 VITAL SIGNS:  Stable.  He is afebrile.
GENERAL:  This is a well-nourished, well-developed 2-year-old little boy, who is appearing very healthy, normal for his stated age, pleasant, cooperative, in no acute distress, looks very healthy, afebrile and nontoxic in appearance.
HEENT:  TMs, canals are normal.  Left naris normal.  Right naris, there is some foul odor as well as questionable purulent drainage.  Examination of the nose, there was a foreign body noted, which was the appearance of a cotton ball in the right nose, that was obviously infected and malodorous.  This was removed and reexamination of the nose was done and there was absolutely no foreign body left behind or residual.  There was some erythema.  No other purulent drainage noted.  There was some bloody drainage.  This was suctioned and all mucous membranes were visualized and are negative.
NECK:  Without lymphadenopathy.  No other findings.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.
ABDOMEN:  His abdomen is entirely benign, soft, nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds active.  No organomegaly or mass noted.
BACK:  Without any findings.  Diaper area normal.
GU:  No rash or infections.  Skin is intact.


ED COURSE: 
 He also had a P-Bag placed, but did not have any urine.  Therefore, a straight catheter was done, which was done with ease without complication and there was no leukocytes noted within the urine.  There was a little bit of blood from catheterization but otherwise normal urine.  X-ray noted some stool within the vault.  Child is acting normally.  He is jumping up and down on the bed without any significant findings.


ASSESSMENT:

1.  Infected foreign body, right naris.
2.  Mild constipation.


PLAN:
  As far as the abdominal pain is concerned, they are to observe for any changes.  Return if worse, follow up with the primary care physician.  The right nose, I will place the child on amoxicillin 125 per 5 mL, 1 teaspoon t.i.d.  Return as needed and observe for more foreign bodies.  I suspect, the child had placed this cotton ball in his nose again after the first episode.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
Left communicating hydrocele.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Left communicating hydrocele.


ANESTHESIA: 
 General.


PROCEDURE:  
Left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.


INDICATIONS: 
 The patient is a 5-year-old young man with fluid collection in the tunica vaginalis and peritesticular space on the left side consistent with a communicating hydrocele.  The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year.  I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options.  All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today.


OPERATIVE FINDINGS:  
The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum.  We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac.  The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region.


DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: 
 The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic.  A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair.  After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine.  A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds.  Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures.  The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents.  The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl.  After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for the final skin closure.  The patient tolerated the operation well.  He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  Blood loss was minimal.  No specimen was submitted.

PROCEDURE: 
 Bilateral L5 dorsal ramus block and bilateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branch block.


INDICATION: 
 Sacroiliac joint pain.


INFORMED CONSENT: 
 The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.

The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.

The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.


PROCEDURE:  
Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.

The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table, pillow under the chest, and head rotated contralateral to the side being treated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopic pillar view was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.

With fluoroscopy, a 25-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and sacrum through the dorsal ramus of the L5 and the lateral and superior border of the posterior sacral foramen with the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.  Approximately 0.25 mL of nonionic contrast agent was injected showing no concurrent vascular dye pattern.  Finally, the treatment solution, consisting of 0.5% of bupivacaine was injected to each area.  All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.


ADDITIONAL DETAILS: 
 This was then repeated on the left side.


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


DISCUSSION:  
Postprocedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to resume normal activities.

The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes or changes in bowel or bladder function.

Follow up appointment was made at the PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately 1 week.

hematology,"
        
        

        
        
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
  Newly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who is noted to have an increase in her liver function tests on routine blood work in December 2009.  Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis.  Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound.  She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm.  She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct.  She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP.  On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.  She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.  A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture.  Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization.  She was also noted to have an elevated CA99.  She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation.  After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  In July, she had eye surgery on her left eye for a muscle repair.  Other surgeries include left ankle surgery for a fractured ankle in 2000.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
 Diovan 80/12.5 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, Lutein 20 mg daily, folic acid 0.8 mg daily and multivitamin daily.


ALLERGIES:  
No known drug allergies.


FAMILY HISTORY: 
 Notable for heart disease.  She had three brothers that died of complications from open heart surgery.  Her parents and brothers all had hypertension.  Her younger brother died at the age of 18 of infection from a butcher's shop.  He was cutting Argentinean beef and contracted an infection and died within 24 hours.  She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia.  She has two adult sons who are in good health.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years.  Her first husband died in 1995.  She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed.  She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well.  She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms.  As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup.  She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure.  She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats.  She has had loose stools.  The rest of her review of systems is negative.


PHYSICAL EXAM:

VITALS:    BP:  108/60.  HEART RATE:  80.  TEMP:  98.5.  Weight:  75 kg.
GEN:    She is a very pleasant female, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  She has obvious strabismus of the left eye with medial deviation.  Her pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Oropharynx is clear.
NECK:    Supple.  She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV:    Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN:    Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No palpable masses.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXT:      Lower extremities are without edema.


LABORATORY STUDIES: 
 Sodium 141, glucose 111, total bilirubin 2.3, alkaline phosphatase 941, AST 161, and ALT 220.  White blood cell count 4.3, hemoglobin 11.6, hematocrit 35, and platelets 156,000.  Total bilirubin from August 25, 2010 was 1.6, alkaline phosphatase 735, AST 123, ALT 184, CA99 is 109.  Bile duct brushings are notable for atypical cell clusters present, highly suspicious for carcinoma.


ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 
 This is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who has findings suspicious for a cholangiocarcinoma.  The patient was referred to our office to discuss this diagnosis.  I spent greater than an hour with the patient and her husband discussing this potential diagnosis, reviewing the anatomy and answering questions.  She is yet to have a surgical consultation, and we discussed the difficulty that we sometimes have with patients meeting surgical criteria to manage cholangiocarcinoma.  The patient also had questions about the Medical University and possibly seeking a second opinion.  She will contact our office after her surgical consultation if she needs assistance with obtaining a second opinion.  We also talked about our clinical research program here.  Currently, we do have a Phase II Study for advanced gallbladder carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma for patients that are unresectable.  We will go ahead and provide her with a consent form so that she can look that over and it will give her some more information about the malignancy and treatment approaches.

REASON FOR CONSULT:
  Altered mental status.


HPI:
  The patient is 77-year-old Caucasian man with benign prostatic hypertrophy, status post cardiac transplant 10 years ago who was admitted to the Physical Medicine and Rehab Service for inpatient rehab after suffering a right cerebellar infarct last month.  Last night, he became confused and he eloped from the unit.  When he was found, he became combative.  This a.m., he continued to be aggressive and required administration of four-point soft restraints in addition to Haldol 1 mg intramuscularly.  There was also documentation of him having paranoid thoughts that his wife was going out spending his money instead of being with him in the hospital.  Given this presentation, Psychiatry was consulted to evaluate and offer management recommendations.

The patient states that he does remember leaving the unit looking for his wife, but does not recall becoming combative, needing restrains and emergency medications.  He reports feeling fine currently, denying any complaints.  The patient's wife notes that her husband might be confused and disoriented due to being in the hospital environment.  She admits that he has some difficulty with memory for sometime and becomes irritable when she is not around.  However, he has never become as combative as he has this particular episode.

He negates any symptoms of depression or anxiety.  He also denies any hallucinations or delusions.  He endorses problems with insomnia.  At home, he takes temazepam.  His wife and son note that the temazepam makes him groggy and disoriented at times when he is at home.


PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:
  He denies any prior psychiatric treatment or intervention.  However, he was placed on Zoloft 10 years ago after his heart transplant, in addition to temazepam for insomnia.

He presents with paucity of speech content; however, with regular rate and rhythm.  He is tremulous which is worse with posturing also some increased motor tone noted.  There is no evidence of psychomotor agitation or retardation.  His mood is euthymic and supple and reactive, appropriate to content with reactive affect appropriate to content.  His thoughts are circumstantial but logical.  He defers most of his responses to his wife.  There is no evidence of suicidal or homicidal ideations.  No presence of paranoid or bizarre delusions.  He denies any perceptual abnormalities and does not appear to be responding to internal stimuli.  His attention is fair and his concentration impaired.  He is oriented x3 and his insight is fair.  On mini-mental status examination, he has scored 22 out of 30.  He lost 1 for time, lost 1 for immediate recall, lost 2 for delayed recall, lost 4 for reverse spelling and could not do serial 7s.

  The patient is a 77-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems, status post cerebellar stroke with episodic altered mental status, mostly at evening time with probable underlying cognitive decline.


RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1.  Encouraged liberal family visitation and frequent verbal redirection by nursing staff to help keep patient oriented.
2.  We would discontinue temazepam and refrain from using other benzodiazepines in this elderly patient as it may cause paradoxical confusion.
3.  We changed Seroquel to 12.5 mg p.o. at noon, 25 mg p.o. at 5 p.m., and 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. as confusion seems to be more prominent at night time and would not want to impair his ability to function in therapy during the daytime.
4.  For breakthrough agitation, we recommend Zyprexa Zydis 5 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. for severe agitation.
5.  Above case and recommendations discussed with Dr. Ranjit Chacko.
6.  Appreciate consults, please contact with any further questions.

        After the suitable risks of the injection were discussed with the patient, including infection and elevated blood glucose levels, and there were no known allergies to the materials involved with the injection, the patient chose to proceed.  The area was cleansed with Hibistat.  Using a clean, sterile, no touch technique, a 22 gauge spinal needle entered over the mid-trochanter with the patient in a lateral decubitus position, the needle was advanced to the femur then withdrawn slightly to inject 10 mL of Xylocaine 1% without epinephrine was injected into the bursa using a 22 gauge needle.  Following this, the syringe with the Xylocaine was removed while the needle was left intact and 1 mL of Depo-Medrol 80 was injected.  This was done without complications.  The patient was told that the injection may cause more pain for two to three days afterwards and if this occurred they would best be served by icing the area 15-20 minutes every 6 hours.  The patient was advised to protect the hip by limiting repetitive bending and excessive heavy use for a week.  Also, they were asked to follow up in two weeks p.r.n.
        


        
"
hematology,"
        
        

        
        
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
 Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
The patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the Pediatric Endocrinology Department by Dr. X for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy.  The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there.  The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  She has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  There have been no skin changes.  Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  Essentially unremarkable.  The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses.  She has had no prior surgical procedures.


IMMUNIZATIONS: 
 Current and up to date.


ALLERGIES: 
 She has no known drug allergies.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  
Currently taking no routine medications.  She describes her pain level currently as zero.


FAMILY HISTORY: 
 There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter.  This was done in Tijuana.  His mom is from central portion of Mexico.  There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  
The patient is a junior at Hoover High School.  She lives with her mom in Fresno.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL:  The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.
HEENT:  The head and neck examination is most significant.  There is mild amount of facial acne.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.
NECK:  There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine.  There are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  No supraclavicular nodes were noted.
CHEST:  Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.
LUNGS:  Clear.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal.  There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.
GENITOURINARY:  External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  This is same as too for her rectal examination.
SKIN:  There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.
NEUROLOGIC:  Normal and no focal deficits.  Her voice is strong and clear.  There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.


DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 
 I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal.  Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative.  There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed.  There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.


IMPRESSION/PLAN: 
 The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  All of the family's questions have been answered.  This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.

PROCEDURE NOTE:
  The patient was placed in a prone position.  The neck was sterilely prepped using a cervical prep set.  A lidocaine skin wheal was raised over the C5-6 interspace.  A 20-gauge Tuohy needle was used.  Loss of resistance was obtained using hanging drop technique.  This was followed by 2 mL of radiograph contrast material which showed spread of the dye into the epidural space.  A total of 5 mL containing 4 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and 80 mg of methylprednisolone acetate were then infiltrated.  Following the infiltration, the patient noted warming of his arms and dramatic improvement of his symptoms.  He was observed for 30 minutes and discharged home in good condition.  There were no apparent complications to the procedure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
  The patient is an 1812 g baby boy born by vaginal delivery to a 32-year-old gravida 3, para 2 at 34 weeks of gestation.  Mother had two previous C-sections.  Baby was born at 5:57 on 07/30/2006.  Mother received ampicillin 2 g 4 hours prior to delivery.  Mother came with preterm contractions, with progressive active labor in spite of the terbutaline and magnesium sulfate.  Baby was born with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at delivery.  Fluid was cleared.  Nuchal cord x1.  Prenatal was at ABC Valley.  Prenatal labs were O positive, antibody negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive.  Baby was suctioned on perineum with good support.  The baby was admitted to the NICU for prematurity and to rule out sepsis.  Baby's cry was good.  Color, tone, and __________ mild retractions.  CBC, CRP, blood cultures were done.  IV fluids of D10 at a rate of 6 mL an hour.  Ampicillin and gentamicin were started via protocol.  At the time of admission, the patient was stable on room air and has feeding issues.  Baby was fed EBM 22 and NeoSure per os.  Ampicillin and gentamicin were started per protocol but were discontinue when blood cultures came out negative after 48 hours.  The patient continues on feeding issues, will not suck properly, was kept in the NICU, and put on OG tube for a couple of days after which p.o. feeds were advanced.  Also, the baby was able to suck properly and was tolerating feeds.  The baby was fed EBM 22 and NeoSure was added a day before discharge.  At the time of discharge, baby was stable on room air, baby was tolerated p.o. foods and was sucking properly, was taking ad lib feeds and gaining weight.


ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
  Respiratory distress, rule out sepsis and prematurity.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
  Stable, ex-34-week preemie.

Pediatrician after discharge will be Dr. X.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: 
 To follow up with Dr. X in 2 to 3 days, an appointment was made for 08/14/2006.  CPR teaching was completed on 08/11/2006 to parents.  Formula feeding schedule with breast and NeoSure 2 to 3 ounces per feed.  Ad lib feeding on demand.

PROCEDURE: 
 Bilateral L5, S1, S2, and S3 radiofrequency ablation.


INDICATION: 
 Sacroiliac joint pain.


INFORMED CONSENT: 
 The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.

The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.

The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.


PROCEDURE: 
 Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.

The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.

With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.  Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.

The following technique was used to confirm correct placement.  Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration.  No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts.  Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached.  At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue.  After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds.

All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure.


ADDITIONAL DETAILS:  
None.


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


DISCUSSION: 
 Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.

The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.

Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks.

COMPLICATIONS:
  None.


DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: 
 INT was placed.  The patient was in the prone position and the back prepped with Betadine.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Xylocaine 1.5% for skin wheal 6 cm lateral and slightly inferior to the bilateral L2 transverse process was made.  A 20-gauge, 15 cm LSB needle was then directed using AP and lateral fluoroscopic guidance until the tip of the needle was just inside the lateral aspect of the vertebral body and on the lateral projection, it was noted to be along the anterior vertebral body, at the junction of the upper two thirds, lower one third of the body.  After negative aspiration 3 cc of Omnipaque dye was injected showing linear spread along the body.  After negative aspiration 18 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected.  Attention was then directed to the L3 level with the tip of the needle guided to the junction of the upper one third, lower two third of L3.  At this point, after confirmation of the linear spread of dye along the anterior portion of the body, negative aspiration was performed and 18 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected.  Neosporin and band-aids were applied over the sites.  The patient was taken to the outpatient recovery room in stable condition.

DIAGNOSIS: 
 Left sciatica.


ANESTHESIA: 
 Intravenous sedation


NAME OF OPERATION:

1.  Left L5-S1 transforaminal epidural steroid block with fluoroscopy.
2.  Left L4-5 transforaminal epidural steroid block with fluoroscopy.
3.  Monitored intravenous Versed sedation.


PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was taken to the block room.  He was placed prone on the fluoroscopy table.  He was monitored appropriately.  He was administered Versed 2 mg IV.  His O2 saturation remained greater than 90%.  His back was prepped and draped.  The C-arm was brought in.  The endplates at L5-S1 were squared off.  The C-arm was rotated to the left.  The L5 pedicle, the superior articular process of the L5-S1 facet, and the &quot;neck of the scotty dog&quot; were all visualized.  After adequate local anesthesia, a 22-gauge, 3-1/2-inch spinal needle was inserted using down-the-barrel-of-the-needle technique.  The needle was advanced into the posterior aspect of the foramen and then advanced anteriorly toward the 6 o'clock position on the pedicle.  No paresthesias were noted.  One-half cc of contrast was injected and spread medially around the pedicle and into the epidural space, and the L5 nerve root was visualized.  Depo-Medrol 80 mg plus 1 cc of 4% preservative-free lidocaine was injected.  The needle was flushed and removed.

I then went up to the L4-5 level, and using a similar technique, injected the patient transforaminally at the L4-5 level.  Depo-Medrol 80 mg plus 1 cc of 4% preservative-free lidocaine was injected at the L4-5 level just as at the L5-S1 level.  The patient had pain down his left leg during the injection, primarily at the L5-S1 level similar to what he normally experiences.  He was awake and alert, and taken to the recovery room in good condition.  His left leg pain was relieved.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Right superior parathyroid adenoma.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Right superior parathyroid adenoma.


PROCEDURE: 
 Excision of right superior parathyroid adenoma.


ANESTHESIA:
  Local with 1% Xylocaine and anesthesia standby with sedation.


CLINICAL HISTORY:
  This 80-year-old woman has had some mild dementia.  She was begun on Aricept but could not tolerate that because of strange thoughts and hallucinations.  She was found to be hypercalcemic.  Intact PTH was mildly elevated.  A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.


FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:
  The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position.  A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient's identity, operative site and operative plan.  The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound.  The patient was sedated.  A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck.  The head was supported in a foam head cradle.  The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes.  After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma.  The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection.  The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally.  The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery.  The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures.  The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward.  Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified.  This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed.  It was sent for weight and frozen section.  It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.

Prior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled &quot;pre-excision.&quot;  It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma.  However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH.  The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory.  The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl.  The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond.  The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery area in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.

IDENTIFYING DATA:  
The patient is a 40-year-old white male.  He is married, on medical leave from his job as a tree cutter, and lives with his wife and five children.


CHIEF COMPLAINT AND REACTION TO HOSPITALIZATION:  
The patient is admitted on a 72-hour involuntary treatment for dangerousness to others after repeated assaultive behaviors at Hospital Emergency Room, the morning prior to admission.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
The patient was very sleepy this morning, only minimally cooperative with interview.  Additional information taken from the emergency room records that accompanied him from Hospital yesterday as well as from his wife, who I contacted by telephone.  The patient was apparently at his stable baseline when discharged from the Hospital on 01/21/10, status post back surgery following a work-related injury.  The patient returned to Emergency Room on the evening prior to admission complaining of severe back pain.  His ER course is notable for yelling, spitting, and striking multiple staff members.  The patient was originally to be admitted for pain control, but when he threatened to leave, he was referred to MHPs, who subsequently detained him for 72 hours for dangerousness to others.  On interview, the patient reports only hazy memories of these incidences and states this behavior was secondary to his pain and his medications.  He was contrite about the violence.  When his wife was contacted by telephone, she agreed with this assessment and reports that he has a history of domestic violence usually in the setting of alcohol and illicit substance intoxication, but denies any events in the last 3 years.

His wife reports that after discharge from the hospital, on 01/21/10, he was prescribed Percocet, Soma, hydroxyzine, and Valium.  He essentially exhausted his approximately 10 days' supply of these agents on the morning of 01/23/10, and as above believes that this was responsible for his presentation yesterday.  She reports that she has been in contact with him since his arrival in our facility and reports that he is &quot;back to normal.&quot; She denies feeling that he currently represents a threat to her or her five children.  She was unaware of his mental health history, but denies that he has received care for any condition since they were married three years ago.


PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: 
 The patient has a history of Involuntary Treatment Act of 72 hours in our facility in 2004 or 2005 for assaultive behaviors; however, these records are not currently available for review.  The patient denies any outpatient mental health treatment before or since this hospitalization.  He describes his mental health diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder; however, he denies a history of dramatic mood swings in the absence of illicit substances or alcohol intoxication.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  Notable for status post back surgery, discharged from Hospital on 01/21/10.


MEDICATIONS:
  From discharge from Hospital on 01/21/10, include Percocet, Valium, Soma, and Vistaril, doses and frequency are not currently known.  His wife reports that he was discharged with approximately 10 days' supply of these agents.


SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:  
The patient is employed as a tree cutter, currently on medical leave for the last 2 months following a back injury.  He lives with his wife and children.  He has a history of domestic violence, but not recently.  Other details of occupational, educational history not currently known.


SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL HISTORY:
  Records indicate a previous history of methamphetamine and alcohol abuse/dependence.  The wife states that he has not consumed either since 12/07.  Of note, urine tox screen at Hospital was positive for marijuana.


LEGAL HISTORY:  
The patient has been charged with domestic violence in the past, but his wife denies any repeat instances since in the last 3 years.  It is not known whether the patient is currently on probation.


GENETIC PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: 
 Unknown.


MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:

Attitude:  The patient is only minimally cooperative with interview secondary to being sleepy, and after repeated attempts to ask questions, he rolled over and went to bed.
Appearance: He is unkempt and there are multiple visible tattoos on his biceps.
Psychomotor:  There is no obvious psychomotor agitation or retardation.  There are no obvious extrapyramidal symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.
Affect:  His affect is notably restricted probably due to the fact that he is sleepy.
Mood:  Describes his mood as &quot;okay.&quot;
Speech:  Speech is normal rate, volume, and tone.
Thought Processes:  His thought processes appear to be linear.
Thought Content:  His thought content is notable for his expressions of contrition about violence at Hospital last night.  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.
Cognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person, place, and date but not situation.  Attributes this to not really remembering the events at Hospital that resulted in this hospitalization.
Judgment and Insight:  His insight and judgment are both appear to be improving.
Assets:  Include his supportive wife and the fact he has been able to remain alcohol and methamphetamine sobriety for the last 3 years.
Limitations:  Include his back injury and possible need for improvement of health treatment engagement.


FORMULATION:  
This is a 40-year-old white male, who was admitted for an acute agitation in the setting of misuse of prescribed opiates, Soma, hydroxyzine, and Valium.  He appears much improved from his condition at Hospital last night and I suspect that his behavior is most likely attributed to delirium and this since resolved.  He reports historical diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, however, the details of this diagnosis are not currently available for review.


DIAGNOSES:

AXIS I:  Delirium, resolved (recent mental status changes likely secondary to misuse of prescribed opiates, Soma, Valium, and hydroxyzine.)  Rule out bipolar affective disorder.
AXIS II:  Deferred.
AXIS III:  Chronic pain status post back surgery.
AXIS IV:  Appears to be moderate.  He is currently on medical leave from his job.
AXIS V:  Global Assessment of Functioning is currently 50 (his GAF was 20 approximately 24 hours ago).


ESTIMATED LENGTH OF STAY:
  Three days.


PLAN:
  I will hold psychiatric medications for now given the patient's fairly rapid improvement as he cleared from the condition, I suspect is likely due to misuse of prescribed medications.  The patient will be placed on CIWA protocol given that one of the medications he overused was Valium.  Of note, he does not currently appear to be withdrawing and I anticipate that his CIWA will be discontinued prior to discharge.  I would like to increase the database regarding the details of his historical diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder before pursuing referrals for outpatient mental health care.  The internal medicine service will evaluate for treatment for any underlying medical problems specifically to provide recommendations regarding pain management.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Low Back Syndrome - Low Back Pain.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Same.


PROCEDURE:

1.  Bilateral facet Arthrogram at L34, L45, L5S1.
2.  Bilateral facet injections at L34, L45, L5S1.
3.  Interpretation of radiograph.


ANESTHESIA:  
IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.


ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 
 None.


COMPLICATIONS:  
None.


INDICATION: 
 Pain in the lumbar spine secondary to facet arthrosis that was demonstrated by physical examination and verified with x-ray studies and imaging scans.


SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was admitted to the OR, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  Prior to sedation vitals signs were obtained and were continuously monitored throughout the procedure for amount of pain or changes in pain, EKG, respiration and heart rate and at intervals of three minutes for blood pressure.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.

The lumbar sacral regions were prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine prep and four sterile towels.

The facets in the lumbar regions were visualized with Fluoroscopy using an anterior posterior view.  A skin wheal was placed with 1% Lidocaine at the L34 facet region on the left.  Under fluoroscopic guidance a 22 gauge spinal needle was then placed into the L34 facet on the left side.  This was performed using the oblique view under fluoroscopy to the enable the view of the &quot;Scotty Dog,&quot; After obtaining the &quot;Scotty Dog&quot; view the joints were easily seen.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed to verity that there was no venous, arterial or cerebral spinal fluid flow.  After negative aspiration was verified, 1/8th of a cc of Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  Negative aspiration was again performed and 1/2 cc of solution (Solution consisting of 9 cc of 0.5% Marcaine with 1 cc of Triamcinolone) was then injected into the joint.  The needle was then withdrawn out of the joint and 1.5 cc of this same solution was injected around the joint.  The 22-gauge needle was then removed.  Pressure was place over the puncture site for approximately one minute.  This exact same procedure was then repeated along the left-sided facets at L45, and L5S1.  This exact same procedure was then repeated on the right side.  At each level, vigilance was carried out during the aspiration of the needle to verify negative flow of blood or cerebral spinal fluid.

The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.

Interpretation of the radiograph revealed placement of the 22-gauge spinal needles into the left-sided and right-sided facet joints at, L34, L45, and L5S1.  Visualizing the &quot;Scotty Dog&quot; technique under fluoroscopy facilitated this.  Dye spread into each joint space is visualized.  No venous or arterial run-off is noted.  No epidural run-off is noted.  The joints were noted to have chronic inflammatory changes noted characteristic of facet arthrosis.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:

1.  Fever.
2.  Otitis media.
3.  Possible sepsis.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
The patient is a 10-month-old male who was seen in the office 1 day prior to admission.  He has had a 2-day history of fever that has gone up to as high as 103.6 degrees F. He has also had intermittent cough, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea and no history of rashes.  He has been taking Tylenol and Advil to help decrease the fevers, but the fever has continued to rise.  He was noted to have some increased workup of breathing and parents returned to the office on the day of admission.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Significant for being born at 33 weeks' gestation with a birth weight of 5 pounds and 1 ounce.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 On exam, he was moderately ill appearing and lethargic.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Tympanic membranes were red and yellow, and opaque bilaterally.  Nares were patent.  Oropharynx was slightly moist and pink.  Neck was soft and supple without masses.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs.  Lungs showed increased workup of breathing, moderate tachypnea.  No rales, rhonchi or wheezes were noted.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Active bowel sounds.  Neurologic exam showed good muscle strength, normal tone.  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.


LABORATORY FINDINGS: 
 He had electrolytes, BUN and creatinine, and glucose all of which were within normal limits.  White blood cell count was 8.6 with 61% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 17% monocytes, suggestive of a viral infection.  Urinalysis was completely unremarkable.  Chest x-ray showed a suboptimal inspiration, but no evidence of an acute process in the chest.


HOSPITAL COURSE: 
 The patient was admitted to the hospital and allowed a clear liquid diet.  Activity is as tolerates.  CBC with differential, blood culture, electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine, glucose, UA, and urine culture all were ordered.  Chest x-ray was ordered as well with 2 views to evaluate for a possible pneumonia.  Pulse oximetry checks were ordered every shift and as needed with O2 ordered per nasal cannula if O2 saturations were less that 94%.  Gave D5 and quarter of normal saline at 45 mL per hour, which was just slightly above maintenance rate to help with hydration.  He was given ceftriaxone 500 mg IV once daily to treat otitis media and possible sepsis, and I will add Tylenol and ibuprofen as needed for fevers.  Overnight, he did have his oxygen saturations drop and went into oxygen overnight.  His lungs remained clear, but because of the need for O2, we instituted albuterol aerosols every 6 hours to help maintain good lung function.  The nurses were instructed to attempt to wean O2 if possible and advance the diet.  He was doing clear liquids well and so I saline locked to help to accommodate improve the mobility with the patient.  He did well the following evening with no further oxygen requirement.  He continued to spike fevers but last fever was around 13:45 on the previous day.  At the time of exam, he had 100% oxygen saturations on room air with temperature of 99.3 degrees F. with clear lungs.  He was given additional dose of Rocephin when it was felt that it would be appropriate for him to be discharged that morning.


CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT DISCHARGE: 
 He was at 100% oxygen saturations on room air with no further dips at night.  He has become afebrile and was having no further increased work of breathing.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Bilateral otitis media.

A 20 gauge, 15 cm needle was then placed in a cephalad medial 45o direction; the tip of the needle was just inside the L1 vertebral body.  On lateral view, this was noted to be approximately 1.5-2.5 cm anterior to the vertebral body.  At this time, 3 cc of Omnipaque dye was injected to the opposite side where the same sequence was performed.  Following this, a mixture of 18 cc of 0.5% Marcaine was injected on each side Neosporin and band-aids was applied over the puncture sites.  The patient was taken to the outpatient recovery where blood pressure was monitored and fluids given as needed.  The patient was discharged to operating room recovery in stable condition.

PROCEDURE NOTE: 
 After discussion of the risks, benefits, and indications, and obtaining informed consent with the family and their agreement to proceed, this patient was placed in the left lateral position and using aseptic Betadine preparation, sterile draping, and sterile technique pursued throughout, this patient's L4- L5 interspace was anesthetized with the 1% lidocaine solution following the above sterile preparation, entered with a 22-gauge styletted spinal needle of approximately 0.5 mL clear CSF, they were very slow to obtain.  The fluid was obtained, the needle was removed, and sterile bandage was placed.  The fluid was sent to laboratory for further evaluation (aunt and grandmother) were present throughout the period of time during this procedure and the procedure was tolerated well.  An i-STAT initially obtained showed somewhat of an acidosis with a base excess of -12.  A repeat i-STAT after a bolus of normal saline and a second bolus of normal saline, her maintenance rate of D5 half showed a base excess of -11, which is slowly improving, but not very fast.  Based on the above having this patient consulted to the Hospitalist Service at 2326 hours of request, this patient was consulted to PICU with the plan that the patient need to have continued IV fluids.  Showing signs of dehydration, a third bolus of normal saline was provided, twice maintenance D5 half was continued.  The patient was admitted to the Hospitalist Service for continued IV fluids.  The patient maintains to have clear lungs, has been feeding well here in the department, took virtually a whole small bottle of the appropriate formula.  She has not had any vomiting, is burping.  The patient is admitted for continued close observation and rehydration due to the working diagnoses of gastroenteritis, metabolic acidosis, and dehydration.  Critical care time on this patient is less than 30 minutes, exclusive, otherwise time has been spent evaluating this patient according to this patient's care and admission to the Hospitalist Service.

COCCYGEAL INJECTION



PROCEDURE:
:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  A gloved little finger was inserted into the anal region and the sacral/coccygeal joint was palpated and the coccyx was moved and it was confirmed that this reproduced pain.  After aseptic cleaning, a 25-gauge needle was inserted through the skin into the sacral/coccygeal joint.  It was confirmed that the needle was not entering the rectal cavity by finger placed in the rectum.  After aspiration, 1 mL of cortisone and 2 mL of 0.25% Marcaine were injected at the site.  Postprocedure, the needle was withdrawn.  A small pressure dressing was placed and no hematoma was observed to form.


POST PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS:
 The patient has been asked to report to us any redness, swelling, inflammation, or fevers.  The patient has been asked to restrict the use of the * extremity for the next 24 hours.

EXAM:
  Single frontal view of the chest.


HISTORY:
  Respiratory distress.  The patient has a history of malrotation.  The patient is back for a re-anastomosis of the bowel with no acute distress.


TECHNIQUE:
  Single frontal view of the chest was evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated MM/DD/YY.


FINDINGS:
  A single frontal view of the chest was evaluated.  It reveals interval placement of an ET tube and an NG tube.  ET tube is midway between the patient's thoracic inlet and carina.  NG tube courses with the distal tip in the left upper quadrant beneath the left hemidiaphragm.  There is no evidence of any focal areas of consolidation, pneumothoraces, or pleural effusions.  The mediastinum seen was slightly prominent; however, this may be secondary to thymus and/or technique.  There is a slight increase seen with regards to the central pulmonary vessels.  Again, this may represent a minimal amount of pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is paucity of bowel gas seen in the upper abdomen.  The osseous thorax appears to be grossly intact and symmetrical.  Slightly low lung volumes, however, this may be secondary to the film being taken on the expiratory phase of respiration.


IMPRESSION:

1.  No evidence of any focal areas of consolidation, pneumothoraces, or pleural effusions.
2.  Slight prominence to the mediastinum which may be secondary to thymus and/or technique.
3.  Slight prominence of some of the central pulmonary vasculature which may represent a minimal amount of vascular congestion.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:

1.  Metastatic breast cancer.
2.  Enrolled is clinical trial C40502.
3.  Sinus pain.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 She is a very pleasant 59-year-old nurse with a history of breast cancer.  She was initially diagnosed in June 1994.  Her previous treatments included Zometa, Faslodex, and Aromasin.  She was found to have disease progression first noted by rising tumor markers.  PET/CT scan revealed metastatic disease and she was enrolled in clinical trial of CTSU/C40502.  She was randomized to the ixabepilone plus Avastin.  She experienced dose-limiting toxicity with the fourth cycle.  The Ixempra was skipped on day 1 and day 8.  She then had a dose reduction and has been tolerating treatment well with the exception of progressive neuropathy.  Early in the month she had concerned about possible perforated septum.  She was seen by ENT urgently.  She was found to have nasal septum intact.  She comes into clinic today for day eight Ixempra.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  
Zometa monthly, calcium with Vitamin D q.d., multivitamin q.d., Ambien 5 mg q.h.s., Pepcid AC 20 mg q.d., Effexor 112 mg q.d., Lyrica 100 mg at bedtime, Tylenol p.r.n., Ultram p.r.n., Mucinex one to two tablets b.i.d., Neosporin applied to the nasal mucosa b.i.d. nasal rinse daily.


ALLERGIES:  
Compazine.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 The patient is comfort in knowing that she does not have a septal perforation.  She has progressive neuropathy and decreased sensation in her fingertips.  She makes many errors when keyboarding.  I would rate her neuropathy as grade 2.  She continues to have headaches respond to Ultram which she takes as needed.  She occasionally reports pain in her right upper quadrant as well as right sternum.  He denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.  Her diarrhea has finally resolved and her bowels are back to normal.  The rest of her review of systems is negative.


PHYSICAL EXAM:

VITALS:    BP:  113/63.  HEART RATE:  84.  TEMP:  99.  Weight:  67.8 kg.  Her performance status is 1.
GEN:      She looks well, in no acute distress.
HEENT:    Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Her oropharynx is clear. 
NECK:    Supple.  She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.
LUNGS:    Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV:    Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN:    Soft.  She has positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXT:    Lower extremities are without edema.


LABORATORY DATA:  
White blood cell count is 7.6, hemoglobin 12.6, hematocrit 37.5, and platelets 287,000.  


ASSESSMENT/PLAN:   
 This is a very pleasant 59-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer.  She is enrolled in clinical trial C40502.  She has completed nine cycles of chemotherapy with Ixempra plus Avastin.  First we thought she might suffered a perforated septum which would bring up concerns with the Avastin.  There have been isolated cases reported of nasal septum perforation that is thought to be related to the Avastin.  She was noted to have a thin septum but it is intact.  We will continue her treatment as planned.  I will see her clinic in four weeks.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Rhabdomyosarcoma of the left orbit.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Rhabdomyosarcoma of the left orbit.


PROCEDURE: 
 Left subclavian vein MediPort placement (7.5-French single-lumen).


INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: 
 This patient is a 16-year-old girl, with newly diagnosed rhabdomyosarcoma of the left orbit.  The patient is being taken to the operating room for MediPort placement.  She needs chemotherapy.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general endotracheal anesthesia.  The patient's neck, chest, and shoulders were prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made on the left shoulder area.  The left subclavian vein was cannulated.  The wire was passed, which was in good position under fluoro, using Seldinger Technique.  Near wire incision site made a pocket above the fascia and sutured in a size 7.5-French single-lumen MediPort into the pocket in 4 places using 3-0 Nurolon.  I then sized the catheter under fluoro and placed introducer and dilator over the wire, removed the wire and dilator, placed the catheter through the introducer and removed the introducer.  The line tip was in good position under fluoro.  It withdrew and flushed well.  I then closed the incision using 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Monocryl for the skin, and dressed with Steri-Strips.  Accessed the ports with a 1-inch 20-gauge Huber needle, and it withdrew and flushed well with final heparin flush.  We secured this with Tegaderm.  The patient is then to undergo bilateral bone marrow biopsy and lumbar puncture by Oncology.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:
  Respiratory distress syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, retinal immaturity.


HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 
 The baby is an ex-32 weeks small for gestational age infant with birth weight 1102.  Baby was born at ABCD Hospital at 1333 on 07/14/2006.  Mother is a 20-year-old gravida 1, para 0 female who received prenatal care.  Prenatal course was complicated by low amniotic fluid index and hypertension.  She was evaluated for evolving preeclampsia and had a C-section secondary to the nonreassuring fetal status.  Baby delivered operatively, Apgar scores were 8 and 9 initially taken to level 2 satellite nursery and arrangements were to transfer to Children's Hospital.  Infant was transferred to Children's Hospital for higher level of care, stayed at Children's Hospital for approximately 2 weeks, and was transferred back to ABCD where he stayed until he was discharged on 08/16/2006.


HOSPITAL COURSE: 
 At the time of transfer to ABCD, these were the following issues.


FEEDING AND NUTRITION: 
 Baby was on TPN and p.o. feeds had been started and were advanced 1 ml q.6h.  Baby was tolerating p.o. feeds of expressed breast milk and baby began to experience some abdominal distention.  The p.o. feeds were held and IV D10 water was given.  Baby was started on Mylicon drops and glycerin suppositories.  Abdominal ultrasound showed gaseous distention without signs of obstruction.  OG tube was passed.  Baby improved after couple of days when p.o. feedings were restarted.  Baby was also given Reglan.  At the time of discharge, baby was tolerating p.o. feeds well of BM fortified with 22-cal NeoSure.  Feeding amounts at the time of discharge was between 35 to 50 mL per feed and weight was 1797 grams.


RESPIRATIONS: 
 At the time of admission, baby was not having any apnea spells, no bradycardia or desaturations, was saturating well on room air and continued to do well on room air until the time of discharge.


HYPOGLYCEMIA: 
 Baby began to experience hypoglycemic episodes on 07/24/2006.  Blood glucose level was as low as 46.  D10 was given initially as bolus.  Baby continued to experience hypoglycemic episodes.  Diazoxide was started 5 mg/kg per os every 8 hours and fingersticks were done to monitor blood glucose level.  The baby improved with diazoxide, hypoglycemic issues resolved and then began again.  Diazoxide was discontinued, but the hypoglycemic issues restarted.  The Diazoxide was restarted again.  Blood glucose level stabilized and then diazoxide was weaned off until daily dose of 6 mg/kg and then the diazoxide was discontinued.  At the time of discharge, blood glucose levels were not being stable for 24 hours.


CARDIOVASCULAR: 
 Infant was hemodynamically stable on admission from Madera.  Infant has a closed PDA.  Infant had two cardiac echograms done.  The lab showing normal antegrade flow across the right coronary artery as well as the left main and left anterior descending coronary artery, then the circumflex coronary artery.


CNS:
  Infant had a head ultrasound done to rule out intracranial abnormalities and intracranial hemorrhage.  The ultrasound was negative for intracranial hemorrhage.


INFECTIOUS DISEASE:
  The patient had been on antibiotics during the stay at Madera.  At the time of admission to the ABCD, the patient was not on any antibiotics and his clinically condition has remained stable.


HEMATOLOGY: 
 The patient is status post phototherapy at Madera and was started on iron.


OPHTHALMOLOGY: 
  Exam on 07/17/2006 showed immature retina.  The patient is to get followup exam after discharge.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Stable ex-32-weeks preemie.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: 
 The patient has been educated on CPR measures.  Followup appointment has been made at Kid's Care.  Calcium challenge has been done.  The patient's parents are comfortable with feeding.  The patient has been discharged on NeoSure and expressed breast milk.

2.  Right acute otitis media.
3.  Severe ear pain resolving.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is an 11-year-old male who was admitted from the ER after a CT scan suggested that the child had mastoiditis.  The child has had very severe ear pain and blood draining from the right ear.  The child had a temperature maximum of 101.4 in the ER.  The patient was admitted and started on IV Unasyn, which he tolerated well and required Morphine and Vicodin for pain control.  In the first 12 hours after admission, the patient's pain decreased and also swelling of his cervical area decreased.  The patient was evaluated by Dr. X from the ENT while in house.  After reviewing the CT scan, it was felt that the CT scan was not consistent with mastoiditis.  The child was continued on IV fluid and narcotics for pain as well as Unasyn until the time of discharge.  At the time of discharge his pain is markedly decreased about 2/10 and swelling in the area has improved.  The patient is also able to take p.o. well.

TITLE OF OPERATION:

1.  Repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.
2.  Ligation of patent ductus arteriosus.
3.  Repair secundum type atrial septal defect (autologous pericardial patch).
4.  Subtotal thymectomy.
5.  Insertion of peritoneal dialysis catheter.


INDICATION FOR SURGERY: 
 This neonatal was diagnosed postnatally with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.  Following initial stabilization, she was transferred to the Hospital for complete correction.


PREOP DIAGNOSIS:  

1.  Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.
2.  Atrial septal defect.
3.  Patent ductus arteriosus.
4.  Operative weight less than 4 kilograms (3.2 kilograms).


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


CROSS-CLAMP TIME: 
 63 minutes.


CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME MONITOR:
  35 minutes, profound hypothermic circulatory arrest time (4 plus 19) equals 23 minutes.  Low flow perfusion 32 minutes.


FINDINGS:
  Horizontal pulmonary venous confluence with right upper and middle with two veins entering the confluence on the right and multiple entry sites for left-sided veins.  Large patulous anastomosis between posterior aspect of the left atrium and anterior aspect of the pulmonary venous confluence.  Nonobstructed ascending vein ligated.  Patent ductus arteriosus diminutive left atrium with posterior atrial septal defect with deficient inferior margin.  At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.


PROCEDURE: 
 After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .

I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.  Given the magnitude of the operation, the unavailability of an appropriate level, cardiac surgical resident, Mrs. X (attending pediatric cardiac surgery at the Hospital) participated during the cross-clamp time of the procedure in quality of first assistant.

PROCEDURE:
  Left L5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection with 40 mg of Kenalog under fluoroscopic guidance.


INDICATIONS:  
The patient is a 78-year-old female with back pain referring into the left side.  She has had a couple of epidurals in the past, both of which led to only short-term improvement with intralaminar and caudal placements.  Therefore, transforaminal approach was selected for today's procedure.

Risks and benefits were discussed with the patient.  She agreed to accept the risks and signed informed consent to proceed.


PROCEDURE DETAILS:
  The patient was placed prone on the table.  The skin was thoroughly cleansed with betadine swabs x3 and wiped off with a sterile gauze.  The subcutaneous intramuscular and interligamentous region was anesthetized with buffered 1% lidocaine.

A 5-inch, 22-gauge spinal needle was directed under intermittent fluoroscopic guidance using an oblique approach at the opening of the L5 nerve root.  Once bony contact was made, a lateral was obtained and showed the needle tip to be against the posterior spinal body in the anterior epidural space.  Then an AP view was obtained which showed the needle tip to be below the 6 o'clock position of the pedicle.


EPIDUROGRAM: 
 Omnipaque 300, 1 mL, was placed through the foraminal opening of the L5 nerve root on the left.  This did show dye spread pattern which was narrowed consistent with foraminal stenosis.  The dye did traverse the foraminal opening and was seen spreading around the pedicle into the anterior epidural space.  It was also spreading peripherally along the L5 nerve root.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She did feel that the needle tip was placed at the epicenter of her pain, and this was improved with the placement of the anesthetic.

I will see the patient back in the office in the next few weeks to monitor response of the injection.

IDENTIFYING DATA:
  The patient is a 45-year-old white male.  He is unemployed, presumably on disability and lives with his partner.


CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 &quot;I'm in jail because I was wrongly arrested.&quot; The patient is admitted on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient has minimal insight into the circumstances that resulted in this admission.  He reports being diagnosed with AIDS and schizophrenia for some time, but states he believes that he has maintained his stable baseline for many months of treatment for either condition.  Prior to admission, the patient was brought to Emergency Room after he attempted to shoplift from a local department store, during which he apparently slapped his partner.  The patient was disorganized with police and emergency room staff, and he was ultimately detained on a 72-hour Involuntary Treatment Act for grave disability.

On the interview, the patient is still disorganized and confused.  He believes that he has been arrested and is in jail.  Reports a history of mental health treatment, but denies benefiting from this in the past and does not think that it is currently necessary.

I was able to contact his partner by telephone.  His partner reports the patient is paranoid and has bizarre behavior at baseline over the time that he has known him for the last 16 years, with occasional episodes of symptomatic worsening, from which he spontaneously recovers.  His partner estimates the patient spends about 20% of the year in episodes of worse symptoms.  His partner states that in the last one to two months, the patient has become worse than he has ever seen him with increased paranoia above the baseline and he states the patient has been barricading himself in his house and unplugging all electrical appliances for unclear reasons.  He also reports the patient has been sleeping less and estimates his average duration to be three to four hours a night.  He also reports the patient has been spending money impulsively in the last month and has actually incurred overdraft charges on his checking account on three different occasions recently.  He also reports that the patient has been making threats of harm to him and that His partner no longer feels that he is safe having him at home.  He reports that the patient has been eating regularly with no recent weight loss.  He states that the patient is observed responding to internal stimuli, occasionally at baseline, but this has gotten worse in the last few months.  His partner was unaware of any obvious medical changes in the last one to two months coinciding with onset of recent symptomatic worsening.  He reports of the patient's longstanding poor compliance with treatment of his mental health or age-related conditions and attributes this to the patient's dislike of taking medicine.  He also reports that the patient has expressed the belief in the past that he does not suffer from either condition.


PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: 
 The patient's partner reports that the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s and he has been hospitalized on two occasions in the 1980s and that there was a third admission to a psychiatric facility, but the date of this admission is currently unknown.  The patient was last enrolled in an outpatient mental health treatment in mid 2009.  He dropped out of care about six months ago when he moved with his partner.  His partner reports the patient was most recently prescribed Seroquel, which, though the patient denied benefiting from, his partner felt was &quot;useful, but not dosed high enough.&quot; Past medication trials that the patient reports include Haldol and lithium, neither of which he found to be particularly helpful.


MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 The patient reports being diagnosed with HIV and AIDS in 1994 and believes this was secondary to unprotected sexual contact in the years prior to his diagnosis.  He is currently followed at Clinic, where he has both an assigned physician and a case manager, but treatment compliance has been poor with no use of antiretroviral meds in the last year.  The patient is fairly vague on his history of AIDS related conditions, but does identify the following:  Thrush, skin lesions, and lung infections; additional details of these problems are not currently known.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
 None.


ALLERGIES:
  No known drug allergies.


SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: 
 The patient lives with his partner.  He is unemployed.  Details of his educational and occupational history are not currently known.  His source of finances is also unknown, though social security disability is presumed.


SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL HISTORY: 
 The patient smoked one to two packs per day for most of the last year, but has increased this to two to three packs per day in the last month.  His partner reports that the patient consumed alcohol occasionally, but denies any excessive or binge use recently.  The patient reports smoking marijuana a few times in his life, but not recently.  Denies other illicit substance use.


LEGAL HISTORY:  
Unknown.


GENETIC PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:
  Also unknown.


MENTAL STATUS EXAM:

Attitude:  The patient demonstrates only variable cooperation with interview, requires frequent redirection to respond to questions.  His appearance is cachectic.  The patient is poorly groomed.
Psychomotor:  There is no psychomotor agitation or retardation.  No other observed extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia.
Affect:  His affect is fairly detached.
Mood:  Describes his mood is &quot;okay.&quot;
Speech:  His speech is normal rate and volume.  Tone, his volume was decreased initially, but this improved during the course of the interview.
Thought Process:  His thought processes are markedly tangential.
Thought content:  The patient is fairly scattered.  He will provide history with frequent redirection, but he does not appear to stay on one topic for any length of time.  He denies currently auditory or visual hallucinations, though his partner says that this is a feature present at baseline.  Paranoid delusions are elicited.
Homicidal/Suicidal Ideation:  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.  Denies previous suicide attempts.
Cognitive Assessment:  Cognitively, he is alert and oriented to person and year only.  His memory is intact to names of his Madison Clinic providers.
Insight/Judgment:  His insight is absent as evidenced by his repeated questioning of the validity of his AIDS and mental health diagnoses.  His judgment is poor as evidenced by his longstanding pattern of minimal engagement in treatment of his mental health and physical health conditions.
Assets:  His assets include his housing and his history of supportive relationship with his partner over many years.
Limitations:  His limitations include his AIDS and his history of poor compliance with treatment.


FORMULATION:  
The patient is a 45-year-old white male with a history of schizophrenia and AIDS.  He was admitted for disorganized and assaultive behaviors while off all medications for the last six months.  It is unclear to me how much his presentation is a direct expression of an AIDS-related condition, though I suspect the impact of his HIV status is likely to be substantial.


DIAGNOSES:

AXIS I:  Schizophrenia by history.  Rule out AIDS-induced psychosis.  Rule out AIDS-related cognitive disorder.
AXIS II:  Deferred.
AXIS III:  AIDS (stable by his report).  Anemia.
AXIS IV:  Relationship strain and the possibility that he may be unable to return to his home upon discharge; minimal engagement in mental health and HIV-related providers.
AXIS V:  Global Assessment Functioning is currently 15.


PLAN: 
 I will attempt to increase the database, will specifically request records from the last mental health providers.  The Internal Medicine Service will evaluate and treat any acute medical issues that could be helpful to collaborate with his providers at Clinic regarding issues related to his AIDS diagnosis.  With the patient's permission, I will start quetiapine at a dose of 100 mg at bedtime, given the patient's partner report of partial, but response to this agent in the past.  I anticipate titrating further for effect during the course of his admission.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Low Back Syndrome - Low back pain with left greater than right lower extremity radiculopathy.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Same.


PROCEDURE:

1.  Nerve root decompression at L45 on the left side.
2.  Tun-L catheter placement with injection of steroid solution and Marcaine at L45 nerve roots left.
3.  Interpretation of radiograph.


ANESTHESIA: 
 IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl.


ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
  None.


COMPLICATIONS:
  None.


INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: 
 Severe and excruciating pain in the lumbar spine and lower extremity.  MRI shows disc pathology as well as facet arthrosis.


SUMMARY OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was admitted to the operating room, consent was obtained and signed.  The patient was taken to the Operating room and was placed in the prone position.  Monitors were placed, including EKG, pulse oximeter and blood pressure monitoring.  After adequate IV sedation with Versed and Fentanyl the procedure was begun.

The lumbar sacral region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion with Betadine and four sterile towels.  After the towels were places then sterile drapes were placed on top of that.

After which time the Epimed catheter was then placed, this was done by first repositioning the C-Arm to visualize the lumbar spine and the vertebral bodies were then counted beginning at L5, verifying the sacral hiatus.  The skin over the sacral hiatus was then injected with 1% Lidocaine and an #18-gauge needle was used for skin puncture.  The #18-gauge needle was inserted off of midline.  A #16-gauge RK needle was then placed into the skin puncture and using the paramedian approach and loss-of-resistance technique the needle was placed.  Negative aspiration was carefully performed.  Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected through the #16-gauge RK needle.  The classical run off was noted.  A filling defect was noted @ L45 nerve root on the left side.  After which time 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine/Triamcinolone (9/1 mixture) was then infused through the 16 R-K Needle.  Some additional lyses of adhesions were visualized as the local anesthetic displaced the Omnipaque 240 dye using this barbotage technique.

An Epimed Tun-L catheter was then inserted through the #16-gauage R-K needle and threaded up to the L45 interspace under continuous fluoroscopic guidance.  As the catheter was threaded up under continuous fluoroscopic visualization lyses of adhesions were visualized.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be @ L45 level on the left side.  After this the #16-gauge RK needle was then removed under fluoroscopic guidance verifying that the tip of the catheter did not migrate from the L45 nerve root region on the left side.  After this was successfully done, the catheter was then secured in place; this was done with Neosporin ointment, a Split 2x2, Op site and Hypofix tape.  The catheter was then checked with negative aspiration and the Omnipaque 240 dye was then injected.  The classical run off was noted in the lumbar region.  Some lyses of adhesions were also visualized at this time with barbotage technique.  Good dye spread was noted to extend one level above and one level below the L45 nerve root and bilateral spread was noted.  Nerve root decompression was visualized as dye spread into the nerve root whereas prior this was a filling defect.  After which time negative aspiration was again performed through the Epimed&reg; Tun-L catheter and then 10 cc of solution was then infused through the catheter, this was done over a 10-minute period with initial 3 cc test dose.  Approximately 3 minutes elapsed and then the remaining 7 cc were infused (Solution consisting of 8 cc of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 cc of Triamcinolone and 1 cc of Wydase.)  The catheter was then capped with a bacterial filter.  The patient was noted to have tolerated the procedure well without any complications.

Interpretation of radiograph revealed nerve root adhesions present with lysis of these adhesions as the procedure was performed.  A filling defect was seen at the L45 nerve root and this filling defect being significant of fibrosis and adhesions in this region was noted to be lysed with the insertion of the catheter as well as the barbotage procedure.  This verified positive nerve root decompression.  The tip of the Epimed Tun L catheter was noted to be at L45 level on the left side.  Positive myelogram without dural puncture was noted during this procedure; no sub-dural spread of Omnipaque 240 dye was noted.  This patient did not report any problems and reported pain reduction.

PROCEDURE: 
 Right sacral alar notch and sacroiliac joint/posterior rami radiofrequency thermocoagulation.


ANESTHESIA:  
Local sedation.


VITAL SIGNS: 
 See nurse's notes.


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: 
 INT was placed.  The patient was in the operating room in the prone position.  The back prepped with Betadine.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Under fluoroscopy, the right sacral alar notch was identified.  After placement of a 20-gauge, 10 cm SMK needle into the notch, a positive sensory, negative motor stimulation was obtained.  Following negative aspiration, 5 cc of 0.5% of Marcaine and 20 mg of Depo-Medrol were injected.  Coagulation was then carried out at 90oC for 90 seconds.  The SMK needle was then moved to the mid-inferior third of the right sacroiliac joint.  Again the steps dictated above were repeated.

The above was repeated for the posterior primary ramus branch right at S2 and S3 by stimulating along the superior lateral wall of the foramen; then followed by steroid injected and coagulation as above.

There were no complications.  The patient was returned to outpatient recovery in stable condition.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was here for joint injection.  She is a 14-year-old Hispanic female with history of pauciarticular arthritis in particular arthritis of her left knee, although she has complaints of arthralgias in multiple joints.  What bother her the most is the joint swelling of her left knee that has been for several months.  She has been taking Naprosyn on her last visit.  She was feeling better but still has significant symptoms especially when she was active.  After evaluation in the clinic, she decided to have a joint injection as it was discussed before.  I discussed the side effects and the complications with the parents and the patient and the possibility of doing it in the clinic, but she decided that she did not want to do it in the clinic and she wanted to be sedated for this.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
 So under aseptic technique and under general anesthesia, 20 mg of Aristospan were injected on the left knee.  No fluid was obtained.  Her swelling was about 1+.  No complications.  No bleeding was observed, and the patient tolerated the procedure without any complications or side effects.  After that she went to the recovery room where is going to be discharged with her parents and see her back in the clinic for re-evaluation in a few weeks after the procedure.  If the patient has any problems overnight, she is going to call us.  If she had any fevers or strange swelling, she is to call us for advice.  We will see her in the clinic as scheduled.

IDENTIFYING DATA:
  The patient is a 36-year-old Caucasian male.


CHIEF COMPLAINT:
  The patient relates that he originally came to this facility because of failure to accomplish task, difficulty saying what he wanted to say, and being easily distracted.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  The patient has been receiving services at this facility previously, under the care of ABC, M.D., and later XYZ, M.D.  Historically, he has found it very easy to be distracted in the &quot;cubicle&quot; office setting where he sometimes works.  He first remembers having difficulty with concentration in college, but his mother has pointed out to him that at some point in his early education, one teacher commented that he may have problems with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Symptoms have included difficulty sustaining attention (especially in reading), not seeming to listen one spoke into directly, failure to finish task, difficulty with organization, avoiding task requiring sustained mental effort, losing things, being distracted by extraneous stimuli, being forgetful.  In the past, probably in high school, the patient recalled being more figidity than now.  He tensed to feel anxious.  Sleep has been highly variable.  He will go for perhaps months at a time with middle insomnia and early morning awakening (3:00 a.m.), and then may sleep well for a month.  Appetite has been good.  He has recently gained about 15 pounds, but notes that he lost about 30 pounds during the time he was taking Adderall.  He tends to feel depressed.  His energy level is &quot;better now,&quot; but this was very problematic in the past.  He has problems with motivation.  In the past, he had passing thoughts of suicide, but this is no longer a problem.


PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:
  The patient has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes.  His only treatment has been at this facility.  He tried Adderall for a time, and it helped, but he became hypertensive.  Lunesta is effective for his insomnia issues.  Effexor has helped to some degree.  He has been prescribed Provigil, as much as 200 mg q.a.m., but has been cutting it down to 100 mg q.a.m. with some success.  He sometimes takes the other half of the tablet in the afternoon.    


SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:

Caffeine:  Two or three cups of coffee per day, and soda at lunch time.  
Tobacco:  Denied.  
Alcohol:  One glass of wine per week.  The CAGE screening questions are answered in the negative.  
Illicit drugs:  None at present.  In high school, he tried marijuana a couple of times, and cocaine once.  We discussed some of the major risk of these substances.


MEDICAL HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:

Constitutional:  See History of Present Illness.  No recent fever or sweats.  Neurological:  No history of seizures or migraine headaches.  The patient did have a wrestling injury that resulted in a hole in one retina, but he had no loss of consciousness with that injury.  HEENT:  As mentioned above, &quot;hole&quot; in one retina.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has been hypertensive in the past with Adderall, and recently he has had some episodes where his blood pressure was noted to be high, which may be related to his back pain.  Pulmonary:  Denied.  Gastrointestinal:  GERD.  The patient has ongoing nausea, which is thought possibly to be related to adhesions.  He has no history of liver disease or peptic ulcer disease.  Endocrine and Hematological:  Denied.  Dermatological:  Eczema as a child.  Musculoskeletal:  Chronic back pain from the herniated disc.  He was involved in a motor vehicle accident, a head-on bus crash in the distant past.  He is presently awaiting evaluation for possible surgery.  Genitourinary:  Denied.  Other:  Denied.


SURGERIES:

Nissen fundoplication for GERD.  Removal of necrotic tissue from his left flank, following an accidental gunshot wound at age 18; the patient dropped a 44-caliber Ruger, which discharged.


ALLERGIES:

No known drug allergies.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:

Prescription:  Provigil 100 mg q.a.m. and sometimes 100 mg in the afternoon.  The full 200 mg dose caused the patient to &quot;feel wired.&quot;  Effexor-XR 75 mg q.a.m.,  Lunesta 2 mg q.h.s.,  generic Vicodin p.r.n back pain. 
Over-the-counter:  Denied.  
Herbal:  Denied.


BIRTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:

The patient believes he was probably born fullterm, but is not sure, after a normal pregnancy.  He had a nuchal cord.  He weighted about 6-1/2 pounds.  He believes he reached the developmental milestones at the usual ages.


ABUSE HISTORY/TRAUMA/UNUSUAL CHILDHOOD EVENTS:

The patient does not really feel he was abused as a child, but there were some significant problems when his father returned from his second army tour in Vietnam.  He had not met his father until 2 years of age.  He states that his father verbally abused his mother.  He can recall that at about age 3, his father left him on the road, in order to shut him up.  His mother eventually put down her foot, and told his father to quit drinking or they would separate, and his father chose to give up alcohol.  This resulted in much better family relations.


FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:

The patient's father has suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, as well as alcoholism.  The patient's mother has had similar symptoms, possibly ADHD, and there is depression on the mother side of the family.  There apparently are a number of family members with alcohol issues.


FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:

The patient's grandfather had a myocardial infarction at age 40, and then died of another MI in his 50's.  The patient's mother had breast cancer.  His father had a stroke and hypertension.  His maternal grandmother was obese and had diabetes mellitus.  The maternal grandmother died of colon cancer.


SOCIAL HISTORY:

The patient was born in Grand Junction, Colorado.  He came to Alaska in 1977; his father left his last term of service in the army in Germany at that time, and they came to Alaska to help a grandparent build a cabin; they ended up staying.  The patient has been married for 9 years.  He has two daughters, ages 8 and 6.


SPIRITUAL BELIEFS:

He denies any spiritual beliefs.


EDUCATION:

He has a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Oregon.


EMPLOYMENT:

He is employed at Fort Richardson, through Colorado State University, as a biologist.


LEGAL:

He denies any legal problems.


MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:

The patient arrived on time.  He is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  He is well groomed and maintains good eye contact.  Intelligence is above average.  Insight and judgment are good.  He is oriented to time, place, and person.  Memory is good for immediate and recent recall of three objects.  He recalls presidents Bush, Clinton, and Bush.  He is able to spell the word &quot;world&quot; in both forward and reverse directions accurately, but with a bit of difficulty in reverse.  Speech is goal-directed, coherent, and of normal rate and tone.  Mood is &quot;good,&quot; but affect is anxious.  The patient becomes more anxious with some of the questioning during the mental status examination, particularly proverb interpretation.  He denies auditory or visual hallucinations.  He denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.  He states that the proverb, &quot;People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones&quot; is &quot;speaking about not being hypocritical.&quot;


FORMULATION:

The patient is a 36-year-old Caucasian male with a long history of depression and attention deficits.  Hyperactivity criteria are essentially absent.  Although medications have been somewhat efficacious, he has residual symptoms that are quite troublesome.


DIAGNOSES:


AXIS I
  296.32 Major depression, recurrent, moderate.  
  314.00 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, inattentive type.

AXIS II
  V71.09 No diagnosis.

AXIS III
  History of gastroesophageal reflux disease, status post Nissen fundoplication, variable hypertension of uncertain etiology, retinal damage from the wrestling injury, chronic back pain.

AXIS IV
  Occupational problems, other psychosocial and environmental problems.

AXIS V
  Current GAF:  54.  Highest in the past year:  54.


STRENGTHS:

Above average intelligence, college education, stable employment.


PROGNOSIS:

Good, if the patient follows through with appropriate treatment.  Without proper treatment, the patient will likely have further substantial deterioration of psychosocial functioning.


PLAN/RECOMMENDATION:

We have checked the patient's blood pressure today, and it is 140/94.  However, he is experiencing a considerable amount of back pain at this time, which likely contributes to this.  We discussed some of the treatment options, and the patient will return within the next few days to have his blood pressure checked again.  If it remains high, he has been instructed to see his primary care provider for further treatment.  If blood pressure resolves with better pain control, we will strongly consider increasing Effexor-XR.  We discussed in some detail the risks and benefits of Lunesta, Provigil, and Effexor-XR, and the patient signed a formal consent form.  

Return to clinic in three weeks.

LABORATORY DATA: 
 Labs are pending.


HOSPITAL COURSE: 
 The patient was admitted for a right-sided pleural effusion for thoracentesis on Monday by Dr. X.  Her Coumadin was placed on hold.  A repeat echocardiogram was checked.  She was started on prophylaxis for DVT with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously.  Her history dated back to March 2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated with pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have mesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated.  Her pericardial fluid was accumulated and she was seen by Dr. Y.  At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was performed by Dr. Z.  Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy, already shows bilateral plural effusions.  The patient improved clinically after the pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms.  Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital with chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left.  CT of the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node.  We reviewed the pathology obtained from the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma.  At this time, chest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies, which were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma.  The patient was then stained with a PET CT, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural pericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy.  She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and intramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4.  This was consistent with stage III disease.  Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%.  She was transferred to Oncology service and started on chemotherapy on September 1, 2007 with cisplatin 75 mg/centimeter squared equaling 109 mg IV piggyback over 2 hours on September 1, 2007, Alimta 500 mg/ centimeter squared equaling 730 mg IV piggyback over 10 minutes.  This was all initiated after a Port-A-Cath was placed.  The chemotherapy was well tolerated and the patient was discharged the following day after discontinuing IV fluid and IV.  Her Port-A-Cath was packed with heparin according to protocol.


DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 
 Zofran, Phenergan, Coumadin, and Lovenox, and Vicodin


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
  She was instructed to followup with Dr. XYZ in the office to check her INR on Tuesday.  She was instructed to call if she had any other questions or concerns in the interim.

CERVICAL FACET JOINT INJECTION WITH CONTRAST.



PREPROCEDURE PREPARATION:
  After being explained the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient signed the standard informed consent form. the patient was placed in the prone position and standard ASA monitors applied.  Intravenous access was established and IV sedation was used.  For further details of IV sedation and infusion, please refer to anesthesia notes.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the appropriate anatomy and symptomatic facet joints.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion and sterile technique was maintained throughout the procedure.


PROCEDURE DETAILS:
  The patient was laid supine.  Appropriate view of facet joints was achieved by placing pillow below the shoulder and turning the head.  The neck was aseptically prepared.  1% lidocaine was used for local infiltration and subsequently a 25-gauge spinal needle was passed down to the C4-5 facet joint under fluoroscopic control.  Positioning was checked and 0.2 mL of dye was injected.  Acceptable dye pattern was seen.  Subsequent 1 mL of a mixture of 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine and 0.5 mL of Celestone was injected after aspiration and the patient was monitored.  Needle was removed and same procedure carried out on the other side.  Postprocedure, no complications were noted.

 Open chest status post modified stage I Norwood procedure.


POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: 
 Open chest status post modified stage I Norwood procedure.


ANESTHESIA:
  General endotracheal.


COMPLICATIONS:
  None.


FINDINGS: 
 No evidence of intramediastinal purulence or hematoma.  At completion of the procedure no major changes in hemodynamic performance.


DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: 
 After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the room, placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Following the administration of general endotracheal anesthesia, the chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and all the chest drains were removed.  The chest was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and previously placed segmental AlloDerm was removed.  The mediastinum was then thoroughly irrigated with diluted antibiotic irrigation and both pleural cavities suctioned.  Through a separate incision and another 15-French Blake drain was inserted and small titanium clips were utilized to mark the rightward aspect of the RV-PA connection as well as inferior most aspect of the ventriculotomy.  The pleural spaces were opened widely and the sternum was then spilled with vancomycin paste and closed the sternum with steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed in layers.  There was no evidence of significant increase in central venous pressure or desaturation.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit shortly thereafter in critical but stable condition.

I was the surgical attending present in the operating room in charge of the surgical  procedure throughout the entire length of the case.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  This is a 53-year-old widowed woman, she lives at ABC Hotel.  She presented with a complaint of chest pain, evaluations revealed severe aortic stenosis.  She has been refusing cardiac catheter and she may well need aortic valve replacement.  She states that she does not want heart surgery or valve replacement.  She has a history of bipolar disorder and has been diagnosed at times with schizophrenia.  She is on Depakote 500 mg three times a day and Geodon 80 mg twice a day.  The patient receives mental health care through the XYZ Health System and there is a psychiatrist who makes rounds at the ABC Hotel.  She denies hallucinations, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation at this time.  States that she does not want surgery because the chest pain that was a presenting complaint has gone away that she did not feel her problem is severe enough to require surgery, and medical records does show in this obese individual that cardiac surgery would present substantial risks and for this individual with the chronic mental illness and behavioral problems of a chronic nature, surgery does present some additional risks.  The patient notes that she has a long history of substance abuse, primarily inhalation of paint vapors that she had more than 100 incarcerations in the XYZ County Jail related to offenses related to her lifestyle at that time such as shoplifting, violation of orders to abstain from substance abuse and the longest confinement of these was 100 days.

The patient is able to write a fairly reasonable explanation for why she does not want to pursue medical care.


PAST AND DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: 
 She was born in XYZ.  She is a high-school graduate from ABCD High School.  She did have an abusive childhood.  She is married four times.  She notes she developed depression when a number of her children died.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  


GENERAL: 
 This is an obese woman in bed.  She is somewhat restless and moving during the interview.

VITAL SIGNS
:  Temperature of 97.3, pulse 70, respirations 18, blood pressure 113/68, and oxygen saturation 94% on 3 L of oxygen.

PSYCHIATRY:  
Speech is normal, rate, volume, grammar, and vocabulary consistent with her educational level.  There is no overt thought disorder.  She does not appear psychotic.  She is not suicidal on formal testing.  She gives the date as Sunday, 05/19/2007 when it is the 20th and 207 when it is 2007.  She is oriented to place.  She can memorize four times, repeats two at five minutes, gets the other two with category hints, this places short-term memory in normal limits.  She had difficulty with serial three subtractions, counting on her fingers and had difficulty naming the months in reverse order stating, &quot;December, November, September, October, June, July, August, September,&quot; but recognizes this was not right and then said, &quot;March, April, May.&quot;  She is able to name objects appropriately.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 Chest x-ray showing no acute changes.  Carotid duplex shows no stenosis.  Electrolytes and liver function tests are normal.  TSH normal.  Hematocrit 31%.  Triglycerides 152.


DIAGNOSES:  

1.  Bipolar disorder, apparently stable on medications.
2.  Mild organic brain syndrome, presumably secondary to her chronic inhalant, paint, abuse.
3.  Aortic stenosis.
4.  Sleep apnea.
5.  Obesity.
6.  Anemia.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
  It is my impression at present that the patient retains ability to make decisions on her own behalf.  Given this lady's underlying mental problems, I would recommend that her treating physicians discuss her circumstances with physicians who round on her at the ABC Hotel.  While she may well need surgery and cardiac catheter, she may be more willing to accept this in the context of some continued encouragement from care providers who usually provide care for her.  She clearly at this time wants to leave this hospital; she normally gets her care through XYZ Health.  Again, in summary, I would consider her to retain the ability to make decisions on her own behalf.

Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.

INDICATION FOR CONSULTATION: 
 Increasing oxygen requirement.


HISTORY: 
 Baby boy, XYZ, is a 29-3/7-week gestation infant.  His mother had premature rupture of membranes on 12/20/08.  She then presented to the Labor and Delivery with symptoms of flu.  The baby was then induced and delivered.  The mother had a history of premature babies in the past.  This baby was doing well, and then, we had a significant increasing oxygen requirement from room air up to 85%.  He is now on 60% FiO2.


PHYSICAL FINDINGS

GENERAL:  He appears to be pink, well perfused, and slightly jaundiced.
VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 156, 56 respiratory rate, 92% sat, and 59/28 mmHg blood pressure.
SKIN:  He was pink.

He was on the high-frequency ventilator with good wiggle.

His echocardiogram showed normal structural anatomy.  He has evidence for significant pulmonary hypertension.  A large ductus arteriosus was seen with bidirectional shunt.  A foramen ovale shunt was also noted with bidirectional shunt.  The shunting for both the ductus and the foramen ovale was equal left to right and right to left.


IMPRESSION: 
 My impression is that baby boy, XYZ, has significant pulmonary hypertension.  The best therapy for this is to continue oxygen.  If clinically worsens, he may require nitric oxide.  Certainly, Indocin should not be used at this time.  He needs to have lower pulmonary artery pressures for that to be considered.

Thank you very much for allowing me to be involved in baby XYZ's care.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 Iron deficiency anemia.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 This is a very pleasant 19-year-old woman, who was recently hospitalized with iron deficiency anemia.  She was seen in consultation by Dr. X.  She underwent a bone marrow biopsy on 07/21/10, which showed a normal cellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis.  On 07/22/10, her hemoglobin was 6.5 and therefore she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  Her iron levels were 5 and her percent transferrin was 2.  There was no evidence of hemolysis.  Of note, she had a baby 5 months ago; however she does not describe excessive bleeding at the time of birth.  She currently has an IUD, so she is not menstruating.  She was discharged from the hospital on iron supplements.  She denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats.  No lymphadenopathy.  No nausea or vomiting.  No change in bowel or bladder habits.  She specifically denies melena or hematochezia.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
 Iron supplements and Levaquin.


ALLERGIES: 
 Penicillin.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
  As per the HPI, otherwise negative.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  
She is status post birth of a baby girl 5 months ago.  She is G1, P1.  She is currently using an IUD for contraception.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 She has no tobacco use.  She has rare alcohol use.  No illicit drug use.


FAMILY HISTORY: 
 Her maternal grandmother had stomach cancer.  There is no history of hematologic malignancies.


PHYSICAL EXAM:

GEN:      She is nontoxic, noncachectic appearing.
HEAD:    Examined and normal.
EYES:    Anicteric.
ENT:      No oropharyngeal lesions.
LYMPH:  No cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
HEART:    Regular S1, S2; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:    Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:    Nontender, nondistended; normal bowel sounds; no hepatosplenomegaly.
EXT:      Reveal no edema.


ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
  Iron deficiency anemia.  At this point, I am going to schedule her for an EGD and a colonscopy.  I am also going to repeat her iron studies.  She had a CBC from yesterday, which showed hemoglobin of 10.4.  Her MCV was still low at 74.2 and the mean cell hemoglobin was 25.0.  I would also like to check her fecal occult blood test x3.  I believe with her low iron levels it is going to be very difficult for her to replace it orally.  I believe she may need intravenous iron infusions.  If that is case, we can arrange for her to find a doctor who can give the iron infusions.  She will follow up with Dr. X.

RE:  Sample Patient

Dear Doctor:

We had the pleasure of seeing Abc and his mother in the clinic today.  As you certainly know, he is now a 9-month-old male product of a twin gestation complicated by some very mild prematurity.  He has been having problems with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath over the last several months.  You and your partners have treated him aggressively with inhaled steroids and bronchodilator.  Despite this, however; he has had persistent problems with a cough and has been more recently started on both a short burst of prednisolone as well as a more prolonged alternating day course.  

Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problems with asthma as well as his older sister.  The parents now maintain separate households and there has been a question about the consistency of his medication administration at his father's house.  

On exam today, Abc had some scattered rhonchi which cleared with coughing but was otherwise healthy.  

We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principles of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this.  I think the most important thing to realize is that Abc probably does have fairly severe childhood asthma and fortunately has avoided hospitalization.  

I think it would be prudent to continue his alternate day steroids until he is completely symptom free on the days off steroids but it would be reasonable to continue to wean him down to as low as 1.5 milligrams (0.5 milliliters on alternate days).  I have encouraged his mother to contact our office so that we can answer questions if necessary by phone.

Thanks so much for allowing us to be involved in his care.  

Sincerely,

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 The patient is here for followup visit and chemotherapy.


DIAGNOSES:

1.  Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
3.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
4.  Anemia secondary to chronic renal insufficiency and chemotherapy.
5.  Hypertension.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 A 51-year-old white male diagnosed with PTLD in latter half of 2007.  He presented with symptoms of increasing adenopathy, abdominal pain, weight loss, and anorexia.  He did not seek medical attention immediately.  He was finally hospitalized by the renal transplant service and underwent a lymph node biopsy in the groin, which showed diagnosis of large cell lymphoma.  He was discussed at the hematopathology conference.  Chemotherapy with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone was started.  First cycle of chemotherapy was complicated by sepsis despite growth factor support.  He also appeared to have become disoriented either secondary to sepsis or steroid therapy.

The patient has received 5 cycles of chemotherapy to date.  He did not keep his appointment for a PET scan after 3 cycles because he was not feeling well.  His therapy has been interrupted for infection related to squamous cell cancer, skin surgery as well as complaints of chest infection.

The patient is here for the sixth and final cycle of chemotherapy.  He states he feels well.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or fatigue.  He denies any tingling or numbness in his fingers.  Review of systems is otherwise entirely negative.

Performance status on the ECOG scale is 1.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

VITAL SIGNS:  He is afebrile.  Blood pressure 161/80, pulse 65, weight 71.5 kg, which is essentially unchanged from his prior visit.  There is mild pallor noted.  There is no icterus, adenopathy or petechiae noted.  CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  S1 and S2 normal with regular rate and rhythm.  Systolic flow murmur is best heard in the pulmonary area.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  Renal transplant is noted in the right lower quadrant with a scar present.  EXTREMITIES:  Reveal no edema.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 CBC from today shows white count of 9.6 with a normal differential, ANC of 7400, hemoglobin 8.9, hematocrit 26.5 with an MCV of 109, and platelet count of 220,000.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma following transplantation.  The patient is to receive his sixth and final cycle of chemotherapy today.  PET scan has been ordered to be done within 2 weeks.  He will see me back for the visit in 3 weeks with CBC, CMP, and LDH.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
3.  Anemia secondary to chronic renal failure and chemotherapy.  He is to continue on his regimen of growth factor support.
4.  Hypertension.  This is elevated today because he held his meds because he is getting rituximab other than that this is well controlled.  His CMP is pending from today.
5.  Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  The scalp is well healed.  He still has an open wound on the right posterior aspect of his trunk.  This has no active drainage, but it is yet to heal.  This probably will heal by secondary intention once chemotherapy is finished.  Prescription for prednisone as part of his chemotherapy has been given to him.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
 I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in regard to his likely recurrent brain tumor.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient was admitted for symptoms that sounded like postictal state.  He was initially taken to Hospital.  CT showed edema and slight midline shift, and therefore he was transferred here.  He has been seen by Hospitalists Service.  He has not had a recurrent seizure.  Electroencephalogram shows slowing.  MRI of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery.  There is inhomogeneous uptake consistent with potential necrosis.  He also has had a SPECT image of his brain, consistent with neoplasm, suggesting relatively high-grade neoplasm.  The patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999.  All details are still not available to us.  He underwent a biopsy by Dr. Y. One of the notes suggested that this was a glioma, likely an oligodendroglioma, pending a second opinion at Clinic.  That is not available on the chart as I dictate.

After discussion of treatment issues with radiation therapist and Dr. Z (medical oncologist), the decision was made to treat him primarily with radiation alone.  He tolerated that reasonably well.  His wife says it's been several years since he had a scan.  His behavior had not been changed, until it changed as noted earlier in this summary.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 He has had a lumbar fusion.  I believe he's had heart disease.  Mental status changes are either due to the tumor or other psychiatric problems.


SOCIAL HISTORY:
  He is living with his wife, next door to one of his children.  He has been disabled since 2001, due to the back problems.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 No headaches or vision issues.  Ongoing heart problems, without complaints.  No weakness, numbness or tingling, except that related to his chronic neck pain.  No history of endocrine problems.  He has nocturia and urinary frequency.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 Blood pressure 146/91, pulse 76.  Normal conjunctivae.  Ears, nose, throat normal.  Neck is supple.  Chest clear.  Heart tones normal.  Abdomen soft.  Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No adenopathy in the neck, supraclavicular or axillary regions.  Neurologically alert.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Strength is 5/5 throughout.


LABORATORY WORK: 
 White blood count 10.4, hemoglobin 16, platelets not noted.  Sodium 137, calcium 9.1.


IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
  Likely recurrent low-grade tumor, possibly evolved to a higher grade, given the MRI and SPECT findings.  Dr. X's note suggests discussing the situation in the tumor board on Wednesday.  He is stable enough.  The pause in his care would not jeopardize his current status.  It would be helpful to get old films and pathology from Abbott Northwestern.  However, he likely will need a re-biopsy, as he is highly suspicious for recurrent tumor and radiation necrosis.  Optimizing his treatment would probably be helped by knowing his current grade of tumor.

She was given Lunesta 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. to sleep.  We are starting Lexapro 10 mg p.o. q.a.m.  She is also given Ativan 1 mg p.o. t.i.d. p.r.n.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
  Cervical epidural steroid injection, C5-6.


ASSISTANT:
  None.


ANESTHESIA:
  Local.


DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was brought to the operating theater and placed prone onto the radiolucent table.  Subsequent monitored anesthesia care was administered.  The C-arm was brought into the operative field and an AP view of the lumbar spine was obtained with particular attention to the C5-6 level.  The neck area was then prepped with Betadine solution and draped sterile.  A metallic marker was placed over the C5-6 lamina and a skin wheal was raised in the skin.  A #20-gauge Tuohy needle was then advanced into the spinal canal using 1% Xylocaine anesthetic and the depth of penetration to the C5 lamina was determined.  The needle was redirected into the interlaminar space and advanced to the previously determined level.  A 10 cc syringe was then placed onto the end of the needle and, using an air-negative technique, the needle was advanced into the epidural space.  When a free flow of air was produced, a solution of 80 mg Depo-Medrol, 2 cc of 1% Xylocaine injectable, and 5 cc of normal saline was then injected into the epidural space.  The Tuohy needle was removed.  Betadine was cleansed from the skin.  A bandage was placed over the needle entrance point.  The patient was turned supine onto a regular hospital bed and subsequently allowed to be awakened from anesthesia.  The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.

PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY - PROSTATE I-125 IMPLANTATION


This patient will be treated to the prostate with ultrasound-guided I-125 seed implantation.  The original consultation and treatment planning will be separately performed.  At the time of the implantation, special coordination will be required.  Stepping ultrasound will be performed and utilized in the pre-planning process.  Some discrepancies are frequently identified, based on the positioning, edema, and/or change in the tumor since the pre-planning process.  Re-assessment is required at the time of surgery, evaluating the pre-plan and comparing to the stepping ultrasound.  Modifications will be made in real time to add or subtract needles and seeds as required.  This may be integrated with the loading of the seeds performed by the brachytherapist, as well as coordinated with the urologist, dosimetrist or physicist.

The brachytherapy must be customized to fit the individual's tumor and prostate.  Attention is given both preoperatively and intraoperatively to avoid overdosage of rectum and bladder.

Currently, the patient lives with mother and requires her assistance to perform ADLs and the patient has become ataxic since November 2006.  Sleeping patterns and the amount is unknown.  Appetite is okay.


PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:
  The patient was diagnosed with severe depression in November 2006 at the Behavior Center in Tyler, Texas, where she was given Effexor.  She stopped taking it soon after, since they worsened her eye vision and balance.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 In 2001 diagnosed with Meniere disease, was treated such that she could function normally in everyday activities including work.  No current medications.  Denies history of seizures, strokes, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or head injury.


FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:  
Father's grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease in her 70s with symptoms similar to the patient described by the patient's mother.  Both, the mother's father and father's mother had &quot;nervous breakdowns&quot; but at unknown dates.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 The patient lives with a mother, who takes care of the patient's ADLs.  The patient completed school, up to two years in college and worked as accounting tech for eight years.  Denies use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.


MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION: 
 The patient is 33-year-old black female wearing clean clothes, a small towel on her head and over a wheel chair with her head rested on a pillow and towel.  Decreased motor activity, but did blink her eyes often, but arrhythmically.  Poor eye contact.  Speech illogic.  Concentration was not able to be assessed.  Mood is unknown.  Flat and constricted affect.  Thought content, thought process and perception could not be assessed.  Sensorial memory, information, intelligence, judgment, and insight could not be evaluated due to lack of communication by the patient.

DISCHARGE SUMMARY



SUMMARY OF TREATMENT PLANNING:

Two major problems were identified at the admission of this adolescent:
1.   Mood swings.
2.   Oppositional and defiant behavior.  

A developmentally appropriate group oriented therapy program was the primary treatment modality for this adolescent.  He participated in at least eight psychoeducational and activity groups.  The attending psychiatrist provided evaluation for and management of psychotropic medications and collaborated with the treatment team.  The clinical therapist facilitated individual, group, and family therapy at least twice per week.  


COURSE IN HOSPITAL:
  During his hospitalization, the patient was seen initially as very depressed, withdrawn, some impulsive behavior observed, also oppositional behavior was displayed on the unit.  The patient also talked with a therapist about his family conflicts.  He was initiated on an antidepressant medication, Zoloft, and he continued with Adderall.  He responded well to Zoloft, was less depressed.  He continued with behavior problems and mood swings.  A mood stabilizer was added to his treatment and with a positive response to it. 


DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC TEST/EVALUATIONS:
  Sleep-deprived EEG was done, which was reported as normal.  His last Depakote level was 57 as per 06/04/04.

His laboratory basic metabolic panel, CBC, TSH were reported within normal limits.  


CONSULTATIONS:
  He was seen by our medical consultant for a complete history and medical examination.  No major acute problems were reported, only the acne.  Treatment was initiated with face wash medication.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:


AXIS    I:
        ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), rule out Bipolar Disorder and ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder).

AXIS   II:
  Deferred.

AXIS  III:
        Acne.

AXIS  IV:
        Psychosocial stressors: Severe, family conflicts and educational problems. 

AXIS   V:
         GAF: 45 to 50.         


CONDITIONS ON DISCHARGE:
  The patient had appropriate mood and was not engaging in self-injurious behavior.  He denied suicidal or homicidal ideation.  
Height: 5 foot 8 inches.  Weight: 134.  Blood pressure: 120/54.  Pulse: 104.  Respirations: 18.  Temperature: 99.


PROGNOSIS: 
  Guarded.


DISCHARGE PLAN:  
  As recommended by the treatment team, the patient was discharged to an RTC (Residential Treatment Center) Program to North Star RTC.  He was transferred by personal staff of that institution.  


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/MEDICATIONS:  
The patient is to continue treatment at North Star RTC.  Discharge medications are Adderall XR 30 mg p.o. a.m., Depakote 250 mg p.o. t.i.d., Zoloft 55 mg p.o. q. a.m.  The prescription was given to the patient's representative.  As other instructions, the patient may continue treatment at North Star RTC with at least once a week family session.  The patient's representative and the patient both acknowledged that they understand all the medications prescribed and how to administer them, and the importance of the next level of care and continuing treatment.  If he experiences any side effects or has any concerns regarding his behavior, safety, immediately contact North Star Hospital.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION: 
 I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
  The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007.  At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy.  Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks.  She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007.  She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y.  Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.

On colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure.  She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion.  Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.

She had surgical resection done yesterday.  The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis.  At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.

Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis.  There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted.  Radial margin was 0.1 mm.  Other margins were 5 and 6 mm.  Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.

Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs.  The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1.  The ovaries were normal.  An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
  She has otherwise been feeling well.  She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy.  She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber.  She was eating well up until the time of her surgery.  She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June.  She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.


ALLERGIES: 
 PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.


MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
  None.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 No significant medical problem.  She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks.  She has no prior surgeries.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  
She smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s.  A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week.  She does not smoke now.  She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine.  She is married and has no children.  An IUD was recently placed.  She works as an esthetician.


FAMILY HISTORY:  
Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45.  This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history.  She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early.  Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44.  Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago.  Otherwise, he has no medical problem.  Mother is aged 82 and healthy.  She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 
GENERAL:  She is in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
SKIN:  Warm and dry.  She has no jaundice.
LYMPHATICS:  No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable.
LUNGS:  There is no respiratory distress.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and mildly tender.  Dressings are clean and dry.
EXTREMITIES:  No peripheral edema is noted.  Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place.


LABORATORY DATA:
  White blood count of 11.7, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 408, differential shows left shift, MCV is 99.6.  Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133.  Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.


IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 
 Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1.  She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled.  Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.

A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis.  Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy.  I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age.  Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit.  Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.

Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects.  We did not review all that information today.

She has a family history of early colon cancer.  Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can.  Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available.  She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy.  She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission.  I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed.  If not, those can be drawn tomorrow.

COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.


SUMMARY:  
The patient in the operating room in the prone position with the back prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The patient was given sedation and monitored.  Local anesthetic was used to insufflate the skin over sacral hiatus.  A 16-gauge RK needle was placed at the sacral hiatus into the caudal canal with no CSF or blood.  A Racz tunnel catheter was then placed to the needle and guided up to the L3-L4 level.  After negative aspiration 4 cc of 0.5% Marcaine and 80 mg of Depo-Medrol were injected.  The catheter was then repositioned at the L4-L5 level where after negative aspiration same local anesthetic steroid mixture was injected.  Needle and catheter were removed intact.  The patient was discharged in stable condition.

        Informed consent was obtained from the patient.  The volar aspect of the left wrist was prepared with Betadine and alcohol and rested at a 45 degree angle on a rolled-up towel.  The palmaris longus tendon was identified and marked and so was the distal wrist crease.  A 25 gauge needle was used to enter the carpal tunnel, approximately 1/2 inch proximal to the distal wrist crease and ulnar to the palmaris longus tendon.  Paresthesias were elicited in the median nerve distribution.  The needle was withdrawn and reinserted slightly laterally without elicitation of further paresthesias.  The needle was advanced through the carpal tunnel without any difficulty.  1 mL of triamcinolone was injected after aspiration.  The medications flowed freely without any difficulty.  The same procedure was then done to the right wrist also using 1 mL of triamcinolone with no elucidation of paresthesias.  After the procedure, the patient clenched and unclenched the fingers of both hands for a period of two minutes to distribute the medication.  There were no complications throughout the procedure and good relief of symptoms following the procedure.


POST PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS:
 The patient has been asked to report to us any redness, swelling, inflammation, or fevers.  The patient has been asked to restrict the use of the * extremity for the next 24 hours.

INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY SIMULATION


The patient will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy in order to deliver high-dose treatment to sensitive structures.  The target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures.

Initially, the preliminary isocenter is set on a fluoroscopically-based simulation unit.  The patient is appropriately immobilized using a customized immobilization device.  Preliminary simulation films are obtained and approved by me.  The patient is marked and transferred to the CT scanner.  Sequential images are obtained and transferred electronically to the treatment planning software.  Extensive analysis then occurs.  The target volume, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected.  In addition organs at risk are outlined.  Appropriate doses are selected, both for the target, as well as constraints for organs at risk.  Inverse treatment planning is performed by the physics staff under my supervision.  These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician and completion of successful quality assurance.

SURGEON:
  Ralph Menard, M.D.


ANESTHESIA:
  Local and IV.


COMPLICATIONS:
  None.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
 After proper consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the fluoroscopy suite and placed on a fluoroscopy table in a prone position with a chest roll in place.  The neck was placed in a flexed position.  The patient was monitored with blood pressure cuff, EKG, and pulse oximetry and given oxygen via nasal cannula.  The patient was lightly sedated.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile classical fashion.

Under fluoroscopy control, the waists of the articular pillars were identified and marked.  Local anesthesia infiltrated subcutaneously and deep extending down toward these previously marked points.  Once the anesthesia was established, an insulated 10-cm, 22-gauge needle with a 5-mm non-insulated stimulating tip was placed in contact with the waists of the articular pillars at the affected levels that were previously mentioned.  This was done under direct fluoroscopic control utilizing a gun barrel technique with PA views initially for orientation and then a lateral view to determine the depth of the needle.  For C3 to C6 medial branch RFTC's, the needles are placed along the ventral aspect of a line that connects the greatest antero-posterior diameter of the articular pillar but remains dorsal to the foramen as seen on lateral imaging.  For a C7 medial branch RFTC, the needle tip is positioned more superiorly such that it overlies the superior articular process.  For a C8 medial branch RFTC, the needle is placed at the junction of the superior articulating facet and the base of the transverse process of T1.

Sensory stimulation was carried out at 50 Hz from 0 to 2.0 volts.  Stimulation was stopped once the maximum voltage was delivered or the patient either described a buzzing sensation indicating that it was a nonpainful nerve, or it caused replication of their concordant pain.  The stimulation was then changed to 2 Hz for motor stimulation and advanced up to 2.0 volts or until motor stimulation was found at that level.  If motor stimulation occurred, the needle was repositioned to abolish it but still cause concordant pain, or the RFTC was aborted at this level.

If the sensory stimulation caused concordant pain without motor stimulation, the area was then anesthetized with 1 cc of Marcaine 0.5% with 5 mg of methyl prednisolone acetate.  Once the anesthesia was established, a radiofrequency lesioning was then done at 65 degrees for 60 seconds.  The same procedure was carried out at all the affected levels.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any difficulties or complications.

HISTORY: 
 The patient is a 4-month-old who presented today with supraventricular tachycardia and persistent cyanosis.  The patient is a product of a term pregnancy that was uncomplicated and no perinatal issues are raised.  Parents; however, did note the patient to be quite dusky since the time of her birth; however, were reassured by the pediatrician that this was normal.  The patient demonstrates good interval weight gain and only today presented to an outside hospital with significant duskiness, some irritability, and rapid heart rate.  Parents do state that she does appear to breathe rapidly, tires somewhat with the feeding with increased respiratory effort and diaphoresis.  The patient is exclusively breast fed and feeding approximately 2 hours.  Upon arrival at Children's Hospital, the patient was found to be in a narrow complex tachycardia with the rate in excess of 258 beats per minute with a successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm with adenosine.  The electrocardiogram following the cardioversion had demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with a right atrial enlargement, northwest axis, and poor R-wave progression, possible right ventricular hypertrophy.


FAMILY HISTORY:
  Family history is remarkable for an older sibling found to have a small ventricular septal defect that is spontaneously closed.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 A complete review of systems including neurologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary are otherwise negative.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL:  Physical examination that showed a sedated, acyanotic infant who is in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate of 170, respiratory rate of 65, saturation, it is nasal cannula oxygen of 74% with a prostaglandin infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute.
HEENT:  Normocephalic with no bruit detected.  She had symmetric shallow breath sounds clear to auscultation.  She had full symmetrical pulses.
HEART:  There is normoactive precordium without a thrill.  There is normal S1, single loud S2, and a 2/6 continuous shunt type of murmur could be appreciated at the left upper sternal border.
ABDOMEN:  Soft.  Liver edge is palpated at 3 cm below the costal margin and no masses or bruits detected.


X-RAYS:
  Review of the chest x-ray demonstrated a normal situs, normal heart size, and adequate pulmonary vascular markings.  There is a prominent thymus.  An echocardiogram demonstrated significant cyanotic congenital heart disease consisting of normal situs, a left superior vena cava draining into the left atrium, a criss-cross heart with atrioventricular discordance of the right atrium draining through the mitral valve into the left-sided morphologic left ventricle.  The left atrium drained through the tricuspid valve into a right-sided morphologic right ventricle.  There is a large inlet ventricular septal defect as pulmonary atresia.  The aorta was malopposed arising from the right ventricle in the anterior position with the left aortic arch.  There was a small vertical ductus as a sole source of pulmonary artery blood flow.  The central pulmonary arteries appeared confluent although small measuring 3 mm in the diameter.  Biventricular function is well maintained.


FINAL IMPRESSION: 
 The patient has significant cyanotic congenital heart disease physiologically with a single ventricle physiology and ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow and the incidental supraventricular tachycardia now in the sinus rhythm with adequate ventricular function.  The saturations are now also adequate on prostaglandin E1.


RECOMMENDATION: 
 My recommendation is that the patient be continued on prostaglandin E1.  The patient's case was presented to the cardiothoracic surgical consultant, Dr. X.  The patient will require further echocardiographic study in the morning to further delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy and confirm the central confluence.  A consideration will be made for diagnostic cardiac catheterization to fully delineate the pulmonary artery anatomy prior to surgical intervention.  The patient will require some form of systemic to pulmonary shunt, modified pelvic shunt or central shunt as a durable source of pulmonary blood flow.  Further surgical repair was continued on the size and location of the ventricular septal defect over the course of the time for consideration of possible Rastelli procedure.  The current recommendation is for proceeding with a central shunt and followed then by bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunt with then consideration for a septation when the patient is 1 to 2 years of age.  These findings and recommendations were reviewed with the parents via a Spanish interpreter.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
  The procedure risks, hazards and alternatives were discussed with the patient and a proper consent was obtained.  The area over the myofascial spasm was prepped with alcohol utilizing sterile technique.  After isolating it between two palpating fingertips a 25-gauge 5&quot; needle was placed in the center of the myofascial spasms and a negative aspiration was performed.  Then 4 cc of Marcaine 0.5% was injected into each trigger point.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any apparent difficulties or complications.  They were feeling relief by the time the block had set.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: 
 Left breast cancer.


HISTORY:
  The patient is a 57-year-old female, who I initially saw in the office on 12/27/07, as a referral from the Tomball Breast Center.  On 12/21/07, the patient underwent image-guided needle core biopsy of a 1.5 cm lesion at the 7 o'clock position of the left breast (inferomedial).  The biopsy returned showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma high histologic grade.  The patient stated that she had recently felt and her physician had felt a palpable mass in that area prior to her breast imaging.  She prior to that area, denied any complaints.  She had no nipple discharge.  No trauma history.  She has had been on no estrogen supplementation.  She has had no other personal history of breast cancer.  Her family history is positive for her mother having breast cancer at age 48.  The patient has had no children and no pregnancies.  She denies any change in the right breast.  Subsequent to the office visit and tissue diagnosis of breast cancer, she has had medical oncology consultation with Dr. X and radiation oncology consultation with Dr. Y.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X and Dr. Y, who are both in agreement with proceeding with surgery prior to adjuvant therapy.  The patient's metastatic workup has otherwise been negative with MRI scan and CT scanning.  The MRI scan showed some close involvement possibly involving the left pectoralis muscle, although thought to also possibly represent biopsy artifact.

We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection.  The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient.  The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained.  Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained.  The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers.  She was certainly encouraged to obtain further surgical medical opinions prior to proceeding.  I believe the patient has given full informed consent and desires to proceed with the above.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 This 40-year-old white single man was hospitalized at XYZ Hospital in the mental health ward, issues were filled up by his sister and his mother.  The issues involved include the fact that for the last 10 years he has been on disability for psychiatric reasons and has been not working, and in the last several weeks to month he began to call his family talking about the fact that he had been sexually abused by brother.  He has been in outpatient therapy with Jeffrey Silverberg for the past 10 years and Mr. Silverberg became concerned about his behavior, called the family and told them to have him put in the hospital, and at one point called the police because the patient was throwing cellphones and having tantrums in his office.

The history includes the fact that the patient is the 3rd of 4 children.  A brother who is approximately 8 years older, sexually abused brother who is 4 years older.  The brother who is 8 years older lives in California and will contact the family, has had minimal contact for many years.

That brother in California is gay.  The brother who is 4 years older, sexually abused, the patient from age 8 to 12 on a regular basis.  He said, he told his mother several years ago, but she did nothing about it.

REASON FOR REFERRAL:
  The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of the Clinic due to concerns regarding behavioral acting out as well as encopresis.  This is a 90-minute initial intake completed on 10/03/2007.  I met with the patient's mother individually for the entire session.  I reviewed with her the treatment, consent form, as well as the boundaries of confidentiality, and she stated that she understood these concepts.


PRESENTING PROBLEMS: 
 Mother reported that her primary concern in regard to the patient had to do with his oppositionality.  She was more ambivalent regarding addressing the encopresis.  In regards to his oppositionality, she reported that the onset of his oppositionality was approximately at 4 years of age, that before that he had been a very compliant and happy child, and that he has slowly worsened over time.  She noted that the oppositionality occurred approximately after his brother, who has multiple medical problems, was born.  At that time, mother had spent 2 months back East with the brother due to his feeding issues and will have to go again next year.  She reported that in terms of the behaviors that he loses his temper frequently, he argues with her that he defies her authority that she has to ask him many times to do things, that she has to repeat instructions, that he ignores her, that he whines, and this is when he is told to do something that he does not want to do.  She reported that he deliberately annoys other people, that he can be angry and resentful.  She reported that he does not display these behaviors with the father nor does he display them at home, but they are specific to her.  She reported that her response to him typically is that she repeats what she wants him to do many, many times, that eventually she gets upset.  She yells at him, talks with him, and tries to make him go and do what she wants him to do.  Mother also noted that she probably ignores some his misbehaviors.  She stated that the father tends to be more firm and more direct with him, and that, the father sometimes thinks that the mother is too easy on him.  In regards to symptoms of depression, she denied symptoms of depression, noting that he tends to only become unhappy when he has to do something that he does not want to do, such as go to school or follow through on a command.  She denied any suicidal ideation.  She denied all symptoms of anxiety.  PTSD was denied.  ADHD symptoms were denied, as were all other symptoms of psychopathology.

In regards to the encopresis, she reported that he has always soiled, he does so 2 to 3 times a day.  She reported that he is concerned about this issue.  He currently wears underwear and had a pull-up.  She reported that he was seen at the Gastroenterology Department here several years ago, and has more recently been seen at the Diseases Center, seen by Dr. Y, reported that the last visit was several months ago, that he is on MiraLax.  He does sit on the toilet may be 2 times a day, although that is not consistent.  Mother believes that he is probably constipated or impacted again.  He refuses to eat any fiber.  In regards to what happens when he soils, mother basically takes full responsibility.  She cleans and changes his underwear, thinks of things that she has tried, she mostly gets frustrated, makes negative comments, even though she knows that he really cannot help it.  She has never provided him with any sort of rewards, because she feels that this is something he just needs to learn to do.  In regards to other issues, she noted that he becomes frustrated quite easily, especially around homework, that when mother has to correct him, or when he has had difficulty doing something that he becomes upset, that he will cry, and he will get angry.  Mother's response to him is that either she gets agitated and raises her voice, tells him to stop etc.  Mother reported it is not only with homework, but also with other tasks, such as if he is trying to build with his LEGOs and things do not go well.


DEVELOPMENTAL BACKGROUND: 
 The patient was reported to be the 8 pound 12 ounce product of a planned and noncomplicated pregnancy and emergency cesarean delivery.  The patient presented in a breech position.  Mother denied the use of drugs, alcohol, or tobacco during the pregnancy.  No sleeping or eating issues were present in the perinatal period.  Temperament was described as easy.  He was described as a cuddly baby.  No concerns expressed regarding his developmental milestones.  No serious injuries reported.  No hospitalizations or surgeries.  No allergies.  The patient has been encopretic for all of his life.  He currently is taking MiraLax.


FAMILY BACKGROUND: 
 The patient lives with his mother who is age 37, and is primarily a homemaker, but does work approximately 48 hours a month as a beautician; with his father, age 35, who is a police officer; and also, with his younger brother who is age 3, and has significant medical problems as will be noted in a moment.  Mother and father have been together since 1997, married in 1999.  The maternal grandmother and grandfather are living and are together, and live in the Central California Coast Area.  There is one maternal aunt, age 33, and then, two adopted maternal aunt and uncle, age 18 and age 13.  In regards to the father's side of the family, the paternal grandparents are divorced.  Grandfather was in Arkansas, grandmother lives in Dos Palos.  The patient does not see his grandfather.  Mother stated that her relationship with her child was as described, that he very much stresses her out, that she wishes that he was not so defiant, that she finds him to be a very stressful child to deal with.  In regards to the relationship with the father, it was reported that the father tends to leave most of the parenting over to the mother, unless she specifically asks him to do something, and then, he will follow through and do it.  He will step in and back mother up in terms of parenting, tell the child not to speak to his mother that way etc.  Mother reported that he does spend some time with the children, but not as much as mother would like him to, but occasionally, he will go outside and do things with them.  The mother reported that sometimes she has a problem in interfering with his parenting, that she steps in and defends The patient.  It was reported that mother stated that she tries the parenting technique, primarily of yelling and tried time-out, although her description suggests that she is not doing time-out correctly, as he simply gets up from his time-out, and she does not follow through.  Mother reported that she and the patient are very much alike in temperament, and this has made things more difficult.  Mother tends to be stubborn and gets angry easily also.  Mother reported becoming fatigued in her parenting, that she lets him get away with things sometimes because she does not want to punish him all day long, sometimes ignores problems that she probably should not ignore.  There was reported to be jealousy between The patient and his brother, B.  B evidently has some heart problems and feeding issues, and because of that, tends to get more attention in terms of his medical needs, and that the patient is very jealous of that attention and feels that B is favored and that he get things that The patient does not get, and that there is some tension between the brothers.  They do play well together; however, The patient does tend to be somewhat intrusive, gets in his space, and then, B will hit him.  Mother reported that she graduated from high school, went to Community College, and was an average student.  No learning problems.  Mother has a history of depression.  She has currently been taking 100 mg of Zoloft administered by her primary medical doctor.  She is not receiving counseling.  She has been on the medications for the last 5 years.  Her dosage has not been changed in a year.  She feels that she is getting more irritable and more angry.  I  encouraged her to see a primary medical doctor.  Mother has no drug or alcohol history.  Father graduated from high school, went to the Police Academy, average student.  No learning problems, no psychological problems, no drug or alcohol problems are reported.  In terms of extended family, maternal grandmother as well as maternal great grandfather have a history of depression.  Other psychiatric symptoms were denied in the family.

Mother reported that the marriage is generally okay, that there is some arguing.  She reported that it was in the normal range.


ACADEMIC BACKGROUND: 
 The patient attends the Roosevelt Elementary School, where he is in a regular first grade classroom with Mrs. The patient.  This is in the Kingsburg Unified School District.  No behavior problems, academic problems were reported.  He does not receive special education services.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 The patient was described as being able to make and keep friends, but at this point in time, there has been no teasing regarding smell from the encopresis.  He does have kids over to play at the house.


PREVIOUS COUNSELING:
  Denied.


DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION: 
 My impression is that the patient has a long history of constipation and impaction, which has been treated medically, but it would appear that the mother has not followed through consistently with the behavioral component of toilet sitting, increased fiber, regular medication, so that the problem has likely continued.  She also has not used any sort of rewards as a way to encourage him, in the encopresis.  The patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder, not otherwise specified, and possibly oppositional defiant disorder.  It would appear that mother needs help in her parenting, and that she tends to mostly use yelling and anger as a way, and tends to repeat herself a lot, and does not have a strategy for how to follow through and to deal with defiant behavior.  Also, mother and father, may not be on the same page in terms of parenting.


PLAN:
  In terms of my plan, I will meet with the child in the next couple of weeks.  I also asked the mother to bring the father in, so he could be involved in the treatment also, and I gave the mother a behavioral checklist to be completed by herself and the father as well as the teacher.


DSM IV DIAGNOSES:  

AXIS I:  Adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct (309.3).  Encopresis, without constipation, overflow incontinence (307.7)
AXIS II:  No diagnoses (V71.09).
AXIS III:  No diagnoses.
AXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group.
AXIS V:  Global assessment of functioning equals 65.

PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:
  Chest pain secondary to fractured ribs, unmanageable with narcotics.


POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS:
  Chest pain secondary to fractured ribs, unmanageable with narcotics.


PROCEDURE: 
 Intercostal block from fourth to tenth intercostal spaces, left.


INDICATIONS: 
 I was requested by Dr. X to do an intercostal block on this lady who fell and has fractured ribs, whose chest pain is paralyzing and not responding well to increasing doses of narcotics.


PROCEDURE DETAIL:
  After obtaining an informed consent with the patient on her bedside, she was placed in the right decubitus position with the left side up.  The posterior left chest wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion and then a mixture of 1% Xylocaine 20 mL and Marcaine 0.25% 20 mL were mixed together and the intercostal spaces from the fourth to the tenth ribs were anesthetized.  A total of 30 mL worth of solution was used.  I also injected some local anesthetic subcutaneously into an area of contusion in the left lumbar area.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  She had no respiratory distress.  Immediately, the patient felt some relief from the pain.  Chest x-ray was ordered for the following day.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Malignant mass of the left neck.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Malignant mass of the left neck, squamous cell carcinoma.


PROCEDURES

1.  Left neck mass biopsy.
2.  Selective surgical neck dissection, left.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
  After obtaining an informed, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed.  Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room.  Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.

Then, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap.  Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.

Then, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass.  The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck.  A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section.  At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen.  Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements.  This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface.  There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated.  At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

With that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck.  This worked out quite nicely.  The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it.  We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A.  When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise.  Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged.  At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.

The same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination.  Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen.  Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate.  The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap.  The flap was replaced in its position.  A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin.  I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated.  It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it.  A pressure dressing was applied.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Estimated blood loss was no more than 100 mL.  The patient was extubated in the operating room and sent for recovery.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
  Metastatic ovarian cancer.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 Mrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic.  She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month.  She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08.  She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y.  At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000.  Her ANC was 0.5.  She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots.  She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis.  She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.

Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath.  Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily.  Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records.  Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions.  She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia.  She specifically denied any fevers or chills.  However, she was complaining of chest pain.  She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough.  When she did cough, it was nonproductive.  While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations.  An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes.  The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate.  A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe.  The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism.  Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT.  There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox.  There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.

At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.

 GENERAL/CONSTITUTIONAL:  She has not had any fever, chills, night sweats, but has had fatigue and weight loss of unspecified amount.  HEENT:  She has not had trouble with headaches; mouth, jaw, or teeth pain; change in vision; double vision; or loss of hearing or ringing in her ears.  CHEST:  Per the HPI, she has had some increasing dyspnea, shortness of breath with exertion, cough, but no sputum production or hemoptysis.  CVS:  She has had the episodes of chest pains as described above but has not had, PND, orthopnea lower extremity swelling or palpitations.

NEUROLOGIC:  She has been diffusely weak but no lateralizing loss of strength or feeling.  She has some chronic neuropathic pain and numbness as described above in the past medical history.  She is fatigued and tired today and falls asleep while talking but is easily arousable.  Some of this is related to her lack of sleep over the admission thus far.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

VITAL SIGNS:  Her T-max is 99.3.  Her pulse is 54, her respirations is 12, and blood pressure 118/61.
GENERAL:  Somewhat fatigued appearing but in no acute distress.
HEENT:  NC/AT.  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctiva clear.  Oropharynx is clear without any erythema, exudate, or discharge.
NECK:  Supple.  Nontender.  No elevated JVP.  No thyromegaly.  No thyroid nodules.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally with decreased breath sounds on the right.
CVS:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Normal S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  No guarding or rebound.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Generalized muscle weakness but no joint swelling or other abnormalities.
SKIN:  No rashes, bruising, or petechia.  No non-healing wounds or ulcerations.
NEUROLOGIC:  She is oriented x3 but she falls asleep readily.  On exam and conversation, her cranial nerves are intact.  She has no sensory loss.  Her strength is symmetric.


LABORATORY DATA: 
 Her white blood cell count is 8.0, hemoglobin 11.1, hematocrit 33.2%, and platelets 29,000.  Her differential shows 2% metamyelocytes, 57% neutrophils, 29% bands, 6% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils.  Her sodium is 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 of 23, BUN 21, creatinine 1.4, glucose 107, and calcium 8.7.  Her INR is 1.0, PT of 12, and PTT 24.  Urinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase with moderate epithelial cells, bacteria, white blood cells, and yeast suggesting of contamination.  Her troponins have been negative x3.


IMAGINING DATA:
  CT scan of her chest on 12/25/08 shows bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left but these are somewhat decreased in size compared to the prior CT scan at the end of November.  There is some consolidative atelectasis at the bilateral basis.  There is some peripheral interstitial opacifications noted in the right lung and to a lesser extent in the left lung possibly consistent with pneumonitis.  There are small peripheral nodular densities in both lungs unchanged compared to prior scan.  There is an enlarged right adrenal gland again noted without change.


ASSESSMENT: 
 ABCD is a very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer known to our clinic.  At this point, she has been admitted for shortness of breath with possible presumed pneumonia.  The possibility of a PE also remains and the plan has been to do a CTA once her kidney function improves.  Currently, she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and Lovenox prophylactically.

At this point, it does not appear that her pleural effusions have increased and this would not be the etiology behind her worsening symptoms.  Her blood counts appear to be recovering from chemotherapy except for the fact that her platelets have gone lower.  It is unclear as to the etiology behind this but may still be related to chemotherapy effect.  This also could be related to consumptive process such as DIC in the face of infections or medication effect.  We will keep track of her blood counts over this admission.

We will continue to follow along through the course of her admission.  She has requested being full code.  I went back and looked at Dr. X's chart after our clinic chart and at the last visit with Dr. X and Dr. Y, she confirmed that she wanted to be DNR/DNI.  I am not sure why this is changed and I will address this issue with her once she is more alert.

Thank you very much for this consult.

REASON FOR VISIT:
  The patient is an 11-month-old with a diagnosis of stage 2 neuroblastoma here for ongoing management of his disease and the visit is supervised by Dr. X.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma, which initially presented on the left when he was 6 weeks old and was completely resected.  It was felt to be stage 2.  It was not N-Myc amplified and had favorable Shimada histology.  In followup, he was found to have a second primary in his right adrenal gland, which was biopsied and also consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology.  He is now being treated with chemotherapy per protocol P9641 and not on study.  He last received chemotherapy on 05/21/07, with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.  He received G-CSF daily after his chemotherapy due to neutropenia that delayed his second cycle.  In the interval since he was last seen, his mother reports that he had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it is now improving.  He is not acted ill or had any fevers.  He has had somewhat diminished appetite, but it seems to be improving now.  He is peeing and pooping normally and has not had any diarrhea.  He did not have any appreciated nausea or vomiting.  He has been restarted on fluconazole due to having redeveloped thrush recently.

Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs appreciated.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and no organomegaly, unable to appreciate a right-sided abdominal mass or any other masses.  Skin:  No rashes.  Neurologic:  The patient walks without assistance, frequently falls on his bottom.


LABORATORY STUDIES: 
 CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel were obtained and they are significant for AST 51, white blood cell count 11,440, hemoglobin 10.9, and platelets 202,000 with ANC 2974.  Medical tests none.  Radiologic studies are none.


ASSESSMENT: 
 This patient's disease is life threatening, currently causing moderately severe side effects.


PROBLEMS DIAGNOSES:  

1.  Neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland with favorable Shimada histology.
2.  History of stage 2 left adrenal neuroblastoma, status post gross total resection.
3.  Immunosuppression.
4.  Mucosal candidiasis.
5.  Resolving neutropenia.


PROCEDURES AND IMMUNIZATIONS:
  None.


PLANS:  

1.  Neuroblastoma.  The patient will return to the Pediatric Oncology Clinic on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07 for his third cycle of chemotherapy.  I will plan for restaging with CT of the abdomen prior to the cycle.
2.  Immunosuppression.  The patient will continue on his Bactrim twice a day on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Additionally, we will tentatively plan to have him continue fluconazole since this is his second episode of thrush.
3.  Mucosal candidiasis.  We will continue fluconazole for thrush.  I am pleased that the clinical evidence of disease appears to have resolved.  For resolving neutropenia, I advised Gregory's mother about it is okay to discontinue the G-CSF at this time.  We will plan for him to resume G-CSF after his next chemotherapy and prescription has been sent to the patient's pharmacy.


PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY ATTENDING: 
 I have reviewed the history of the patient.  This is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma who received chemotherapy with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin on 05/21/07 for cycle 2 of POG-9641 due to his prior history of neutropenia, he has been on G-CSF.  His ANC is nicely recovered.  He will have a restaging CT prior to his next cycle of chemotherapy and then return for cycle 3 chemotherapy on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07.  He continues on fluconazole for recent history of thrush.  Plans are otherwise documented above.

REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
  Acute deep venous thrombosis, right lower extremity with bilateral pulmonary embolism, on intravenous heparin complicated with acute renal failure for evaluation.


HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  
Briefly, this is a 36-year-old robust Caucasian gentleman with no significant past medical or surgical history, who works as a sales representative, doing a lot of traveling by plane and car and attending several sales shows, developed acute shortness of breath with an episode of syncope this weekend and was brought in by paramedics to Hospital.  A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism.  A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis.  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct.  Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today.  He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow.  Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication.  He denies any recent injury to his lower extremity and in fact denied any calf pain or swelling.


PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:  
Unremarkable.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 He is married and has 1 son.  He has a brother who is healthy.  There is no history of tobacco use or alcohol use.


FAMILY HISTORY:
  No family history of hypercoagulable condition.


MEDICATIONS:  
Advil p.r.n.


ALLERGIES: 
 NONE.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 Essentially unremarkable except for sudden onset dyspnea on easy exertion complicated with episode of syncope.  He denied any hemoptysis.  He denied any calf swelling or pain.  Lately, he has been traveling and has been sitting behind a desk for a long period of time.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL:  He is a robust young gentleman, awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable.
HEENT:  Sclerae anicteric.  Conjunctivae normal.  Oropharynx normal.
NECK:  No adenopathy or thyromegaly.  No jugular venous distention.
HEART:  Regular.
LUNGS:  Bilateral air entry.
ABDOMEN:  Obese and benign.
EXTREMITIES:  No calf swelling or calf tenderness appreciated.
SKIN:  No petechiae or ecchymosis.
NEUROLOGIC:  Nonfocal.


LABORATORY FINDINGS:
  Blood count obtained showed a white count of 16.8, hemoglobin 14.8 g percent, hematocrit 44.6%, MCV 94, and platelet count 209,000.  Liver profile normal.  Thyroid study revealed a TSH of 1.3.  Prothrombin time/INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 78.6 seconds.  Renal function, BUN 44 and creatinine 5.7.  Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 65%, no intramural thrombus noted.


IMPRESSION:

1.  Bilateral pulmonary embolism, most consistent with emboli from right lower extremity, on intravenous heparin, rule out hereditary hypercoagulable state.
2.  Leukocytosis, most likely leukemoid reaction secondary to acute pulmonary embolism/renal infarction, doubt presence of myeloproliferative disorder.
3.  Acute renal failure secondary to embolic right renal infarction.
4.  Obesity.


PLAN: 
 From hematologic standpoint, we will await hypercoagulable studies, which have all been sent on admission to see if a hereditary component is at play.  For now, we will continue intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with Coumadin.  In view of worsening renal function, may need temporary hemodialysis until renal function improves.  I discussed at length with the patient's wife at the bedside.

RE:  XXXX, XXXX 
MR#:  0000000

Dear Dr. XYZ: 

XXXX was seen in followup in the Pediatric Urology Clinic.  I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. 

When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. 

Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. 

Sincerely yours,

RE:  ABC
MEDICAL RECORD#:  123

Dear Dr. XYZ:

I saw ABC back in Neuro-Oncology Clinic today.  He comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma.

Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion.  The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent.  It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective.  Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.

After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen.  They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks.  They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.

From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him.  This is very worrisome.  Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.  Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor.  It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.

Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation.  Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible.  It is not that he does not want treatment, however.  Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen.  We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days.  In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day.  If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us.  At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.

While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval.  In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.  I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.

I will keep you apprised of followups.  If you have any questions or if I could be of any further assistance, feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY FOR CURATIVE INTENT PATIENTS


This patient is receiving combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy in an effort to maximize the chance of control of this cancer.  The chemotherapy is given in addition to the radiotherapy, not only to act as a cytotoxic agent on its own, but also to potentiate and enhance the effect of radiotherapy on tumor cells.  It has been shown in the literature that this will maximize the chance of control.

During the course of the treatment, the patient's therapy must be closely monitored by the attending physician to be sure that the proper chemotherapy drugs are given at the proper time during the radiotherapy course.  It is also important to closely monitor the patient to know when treatment with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy needs to be held.  This combined treatment usually produces greater side effects than either treatment alone, and these need to be constantly monitored and treatment initiated on a timely basis to minimize these effects.  In accordance, this requires more frequency consultation and coordination with the medical oncologist.  Therefore, this becomes a very time intensive treatment and justifies CPT Code 77470.

        After the suitable risks of the injection were discussed with the patient, including infection and elevated blood glucose levels, and there were no known allergies to the materials involved with the injection, the patient chose to proceed.  The area was cleansed with Hibistat.  Using a clean, sterile, no touch technique, through the superolateral approach directed medial to the underside of the patella, 10 mL of Xylocaine 1% without epinephrine was injected into the knee joint using a twenty two gauge inch and a half needle.  Following this, the syringe with the Xylocaine was removed while the needle was left intact and 1 mL of Depo-Medrol 80 was injected.  This was done without complications.

The patient was told that the injection may cause more pain for two to three days afterwards and if this occurred they would best be served by icing the area 15-20 minutes every 6 hours.  The patient was advised to protect the knee by limiting repetitive bending, squatting , kneeling and excessive heavy use for a week.  Also, they were asked to follow up in two weeks p.r.n.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Metastatic papillary cancer, left neck.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Metastatic papillary cancer, left neck.


OPERATION PERFORMED: 
 Left neck dissection.


ANESTHESIA:  
General endotracheal.


INDICATIONS: 
 The patient is a very nice gentleman, who has had thyroid cancer, papillary cell type, removed with a total thyroidectomy and then subsequently recurrent disease was removed with a paratracheal dissection.  He now has evidence of lesion in the left mid neck and the left superior neck on ultrasound, which are suspicious for recurrent cancer.  Left neck dissection is indicated.


DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: 
 The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position.  After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the table was then turned.  A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was placed in an extended fashion.  The left neck, chest, and face were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion.  A hockey stick skin incision was performed, extending a previous incision line superiorly towards the mastoid cortex through skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with Bovie electrocautery on cut mode.  Subplatysmal superior and inferior flaps were raised.  The dissection was left lateral neck dissection encompassing zones 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and the superior portion of 4.  The sternocleidomastoid muscle was unwrapped at its fascial attachment and this was taken back posterior to the XI cranial nerve into the superior posterior most triangle of the neck.  This was carried forward off of the deep rooted muscles including the splenius capitis and anterior and middle scalenes taken medially off of these muscles including the fascia of the muscles, stripped from the carotid artery, the X cranial nerve, the internal jugular vein and then carried anteriorly to the lateral most extent of the dissection previously done by Dr. X in the paratracheal region.  The submandibular gland was removed as well.  The X, XI, and XII cranial nerves were preserved.  The internal jugular vein and carotid artery were preserved as well.  Copious irrigation of the wound bed showed no identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure.  There were two obviously positive nodes in this neck dissection.  One was left medial neck just lateral to the previous tracheal dissection and one was in the mid region of zone 2.  A #10 flat fluted Blake drain was placed through a separate stab incision and it was secured to the skin with a 2-0 silk ligature.  The wound was closed in layers using a 3-0 Vicryl in a buried knot interrupted fashion for the subcutaneous tissue and the skin was closed with staples.  A fluff and Kling pressure dressing was then applied.  The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.  There were no intraoperative complications.

SUBJECTIVE:
  This is a 6-year-old male who comes in rechecking his ADHD medicines.  We placed him on Adderall, first time he has been on a stimulant medication last month.  Mother said the next day, he had a wonderful improvement, and he has been doing very well with the medicine.  She has two concerns.  It seems like first thing in the morning after he takes the medicine and it seems like it takes a while for the medicine to kick in.  It wears off about 2 and they have problems in the evening with him.  He was initially having difficulty with his appetite but that seems to be coming back but it is more the problems early in the morning after he takes this medicine than in the afternoon when the thing wears off.  His teachers have seen a dramatic improvement and she did miss a dose this past weekend and said he was just horrible.  The patient even commented that he thought he needed his medication.


PAST HISTORY:
  Reviewed from appointment on 08/16/2004.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
  He is on Adderall XR 10 mg once daily.


ALLERGIES: 
 To medicines are none.


FAMILY AND SOCIAL HISTORY:
  Reviewed from appointment on 08/16/2004.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
  He has been having problems as mentioned in the morning and later in the afternoon but he has been eating well, sleeping okay.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.


OBJECTIVE:
  Weight is 46.5 pounds, which is down just a little bit from his appointment last month.  He was 49 pounds, but otherwise, fairly well controlled, not all that active in the exam room.  Physical exam itself was deferred today because he has otherwise been very healthy.


ASSESSMENT:
  At this point is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, doing fairly well with the Adderall.


PLAN:
  Discussed with mother two options.  Switch him to the Ritalin LA, which I think has better release of the medicine early in the morning or to increase his Adderall dose.  As far as the afternoon, if she really wanted him to be on the medication, we will do a small dose of the Adderall, which she would prefer.  So I have decided at this point to increase him to the Adderall XR 15 mg in the morning and then Adderall 5 mg in the afternoon.  Mother is to watch his diet.  We would like to recheck his weight if he is doing very well, in two months.  But if there are any problems, especially in the morning then we would do the Ritalin LA.  Mother understands and will call if there are problems.  Approximately 25 minutes spent with patient, all in discussion.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Nonpalpable neoplasm, right breast.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Deferred for Pathology.


PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  
Needle localized wide excision of nonpalpable neoplasm, right breast.


SPECIMEN: 
 Mammography.


GROSS FINDINGS:  
This 53-year-old Caucasian female who had a nonpalpable neoplasm detected by mammography in the right breast.  After excision of neoplasm, there was a separate 1 x 2 cm nodule palpated within the cavity.  This too was excised.


OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  
The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position in the operating table.  Intravenous sedation was administered by the Anesthesia Department.  The Kopans wire was trimmed to an appropriate length.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  Local anesthetic consisting of 1% lidocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the proposed line of incision.  A curvilinear circumareolar incision was then made with a #15 scalpel blade close to the wire.  The wire was stabilized and brought to protrude through the incision.  Skin flaps were then generated with electrocautery.  A generous core tissue was grasped with Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery.  Prior to complete excision, the superior margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut short.  The lateral margin was marked with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, which was tied and cut along.  The posterior margin was marked with a #2-0 Polydek suture, which was tied and cut.

The specimen was then completely excised and sent off the operative field as specimen where specimen mammography confirmed the excision of the mammographically detected neoplasm.  On palpation of the cavity, there was felt to be a second nodule further medial and this was grasped with an Allis forceps and excised with electrocautery and sent off the field as a separate specimen.  Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  The incision was closed in two layers.  The first layer consisting of a subcuticular inverted interrupted sutures of #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The second layer consisted of Steri-Strips on the epidermis.  A pressure dressing of fluff, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastic bandage was applied.  The patient tolerated the surgery well.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
This is a 23-year-old married man who had an onset of aplastic anemia in December, underwent a bone marrow transplant in the end of March, has developed very severe graft-versus-host reaction.  Psychiatric consultation has been requested as the patient has been noncompliant with treatment, leave the unit, does not return when requested, and it was unclear as to whether this is secondary to confusion or willful behavior.

The patient gives a significant history of behavioral problems from late adolescence until the onset of illness, states he had lot of trouble with law, he was convicted of assault, he was also arrested with small amount of cannabis, states he served one year incarcerated in ABCD that was about two years ago.  Gives an ongoing history of substance abuse until one year ago when he went into a drug rehabilitation program, he was discharged from that on 05/28/2006 and states he has been clean and sober since then.  Prior to going to rehabilitation, he was using intravenous heroin couple of times a week since age 17, which would have been over a period of about five years, reports heavy use of cannabis, smoking pot up to five times a day if he could.  He would drink up to half of a fifth of rum on a daily basis when available.

The patient is currently on Lexapro 10 mg in the morning and diazepam 10 mg at bedtime.  He complained of some depressive and some anxiety symptoms, but these do not appear to be out of proportion to his medical issues and, for this individual, the frustrations of his treatments.  He would have a limited support system here in Colorado.  He married in January and states that the marriage is not going particularly well, being young, sick, and hospitalized, has not helped his relationship with his new wife who apparently is expecting a child in July.  I would recommend some couples counseling as a part of their treatment here.

The patient was fairly drowsy during the interview and full past and developmental history was not obtained.  The patient's comment is that he grew up all over, that his parents had separated, that he lived with his mother, that he dropped out of school in eleventh grade, at that time was living in XYZ area because he did not like school.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  


GENERAL: 
 This is a cooperative man, speech is soft and difficult to understand.  There is no thought disorder and no hallucination.  He denies being suicidal, but does express at times feelings about giving up on his treatments and primarily complaints about feeling that he is treated like a child and confined in the hospital.

VITAL SIGNS: 
 Temperature 97.2, pulse 117, respirations 16, blood pressure 127/74, oxygen saturation 97%, and weight is 154 pounds.

PSYCHIATRY:
  There is no thought disorder, no paranoia, no delusions, and no psychotic symptoms.  Activities of daily living (ADLs) appear intact.  On formal testing, he is oriented to place.  He can give a reasonable recitation of his medical history.  He is oriented to the year, knows it is the 15th, but gave the month as June instead of May.  He can memorize four items, repeats three out of four at five minutes, gives the fourth through the category, which places short-term memory in normal limits.  He can do serial three subtractions accurately, can name objects appropriately.


LABORATORY DATA:
  Sodium of 135, BUN of 24, and glucose 119.  GGT of 355, ALT of 97, LDH of 703, and alk phos of 144.  FK506 is 28.8, which is elevated tacrolimus level.  Hematocrit 29% and white count is 7000.


DIAGNOSES:  


AXIS I:
  Depressive disorder secondary to the underlying medical condition of graft-versus-host reaction.

AXIS II: 
 Personality disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS).

AXIS III: 
 History of polysubstance abuse, in remission.


RECOMMENDATIONS:  

1.  This patient appears to retain the ability to make decisions on his own behalf.  I think he is mentally competent.  Unfortunately, his impulsive low frustration personality dynamics do not fit well with the demands and requirements for treatment of this chronic illness.  If the patient refuses treatment, he understands that the consequences of this would likely be hastened mortality and he does state that he does not want to die.
2.  The patient does complain of depressed mood, also of anxiety.  We did discuss medications.  He appeared somewhat sedated at the time of my interview.  I would recommend that we try Seroquel 25 mg twice daily on an as-needed basis to see if this diminishes anxiety.  I will have Dr. X followup with him.

Please feel free to contact me at digital pager if additional information is needed.

My overall recommendation would be that the patient be on some random urine drug screening, that he use cell phone if he goes off the unit, to be called back up when treatments are scheduled, and hopefully he will be agreeable to complying with this.

DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was taken to the Radiology Suite and was placed in the prone position where the entire back region was scrubbed, prepped, and draped in a sterile fashion with Betadine solution.  The lumbar area was then draped with sterile towels and sterile drapes.  The surgeon was gloved with sterile gloves and mask in order to create a sterile environment for the epidural injection.  The fluoroscopy x-ray unit was then brought into the sterile field for a PA x-ray visualization of the spine.  A Steinmann pin was then placed across the spine to localize the level of the planned injection.  Local infiltration using 0.5% preservative-free Xylocaine via a 25-gauge needle was then placed into the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.  A Tuohy needle was then oriented perpendicular to the skin and was then advanced through the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.  Continuous injection of 0.5% preservative-free Xylocaine was used during the advancement of the Tuohy needle into the deeper spinous tissues.  A solution of 80 mg of Depo-Medrol with 2 cc of 1% Xylocaine injectable and 5 cc of normal saline were then injected into the epidural space.

CAUDAL EPIDURAL STEROID INJECTION



PROCEDURE:
:
1.  Caudal epidural steroid injection with contrast.
2.  Utilization of fluoroscopy for confirmation of needle placement.


PREPROCEDURE PREPARATION:
  After being explained the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient signed the standard informed consent form.  The patient was placed in the prone position and standard ASA monitors applied.  Intravenous access was established and IV sedation was used.  For further details of IV sedation and infusion, please refer to anesthesia notes.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the appropriate anatomy.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion and sterile technique was maintained throughout the procedure.


PROCEDURE DETAILS:
   The sacral hiatus was identified by lateral fluoroscopy, and overlying skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine plain.  A 22-gauge needle was used to penetrate the sacrococcygeal ligament.  Correct needle placement was confirmed by both AP and lateral fluoroscopy.  After negative aspiration, administration of 0.5 mL of the contrast revealed correct needle placement within the sacral canal, as confirmed once again by biplanar fluoroscopy.  There was neither intravascular nor intradural uptake.  An additional 4.5 mL of contrast was administered, revealing additional epidural flow.  After negative aspiration, 17 mL of medication were slowly administered followed by needle removal.  The medication consisted of 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine plain, plus 12 mg of betamethasone diluted in 10 mL of preservative-free normal saline.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.


POSTPROCEDURE EVALUATION:
   After a 30-minute recovery period, during which no complications were noted, the patient was discharged home.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman who underwent right thoracoscopy and was found to have biopsy-proven mesothelioma.  He was brought to the operating room now for Port-A-Cath placement for chemotherapy.  After informed consent was obtained with the patient, the patient was taken to the operating room, placed in supine position.  After induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, routine prep and drape of the left chest, left subclavian vein was cannulated with #18 gauze needle, and guidewire was inserted.  Needle was removed.  Small incision was made large enough to harbor the port.  Dilator and introducers were then placed over the guidewire.  Guidewire and dilator were removed, and a Port-A-Cath was introduced in the subclavian vein through the introducers.  Introducers were peeled away without difficulty.  He measured with fluoroscopy and cut to the appropriate length.  The tip of the catheter was noted to be at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium.  It was then connected to the hub of the port.  Port was then aspirated for patency and flushed with heparinized saline and summoned to the chest wall.  Wounds were then closed.  Needle count, sponge count, and instrument counts were all correct.

The patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the Pediatric Endocrinology Department by Dr. X for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy.  The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004.  An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed.  When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there.  The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.  The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction.  She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism.  There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family.  She has no notable discomfort with this lesion.  There have been no skin changes.  Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  Essentially unremarkable.  The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses.  She has had no prior surgical procedures.


IMMUNIZATIONS: 
 Current and up to date.


ALLERGIES: 
 She has no known drug allergies.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  
Currently taking no routine medications.  She describes her pain level currently as zero.


FAMILY HISTORY: 
 There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter.  This was done in Tijuana.  His mom is from central portion of Mexico.  There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  
The patient is a junior at Hoover High School.  She lives with her mom in Fresno.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
 A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL:  The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress.  She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.
HEENT:  The head and neck examination is most significant.  There is mild amount of facial acne.  The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.
NECK:  There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus.  A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid.  This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine.  There are some shotty adenopathy in the area.  No supraclavicular nodes were noted.
CHEST:  Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.
LUNGS:  Clear.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Normal.  There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.
ABDOMEN:  Benign.
EXTREMITIES:  Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.
GENITOURINARY:  External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia.  This is same as too for her rectal examination.
SKIN:  There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.
NEUROLOGIC:  Normal and no focal deficits.  Her voice is strong and clear.  There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.


DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: 
 I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range.  T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal.  Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative.  There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this.  A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable.  A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed.  There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.


IMPRESSION/PLAN: 
 The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary.  The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease.  I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease.  During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy.  We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation.  We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well.  I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them.  I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit.  This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy.  The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case.  I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity.  All of the family's questions have been answered.  This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family.  I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done.  We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Pilonidal cyst with abscess formation.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Pilonidal cyst with abscess formation.


OPERATION: 
 Excision of infected pilonidal cyst.


PROCEDURE: 
 After obtaining informed consent, the patient underwent a spinal anesthetic and was placed in the prone position in the operating room.  A time-out process was followed.  Antibiotics were given and then the patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  It appeared to me that the abscess had drained somewhat during the night, as it was much smaller than I was anticipating.  An elliptical excision of all infected tissues down to the coccyx was performed.  Hemostasis was achieved with a cautery.  The wound was irrigated with normal saline and it was packed open with iodoform gauze and an absorptive dressing.

The patient was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.  Estimated blood loss was minimal.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Invasive carcinoma of left breast.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Invasive carcinoma of left breast.


OPERATION PERFORMED:
  Left modified radical mastectomy.


ANESTHESIA: 
 General endotracheal.


INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:  
The patient is a 52-year-old female who recently underwent a left breast biopsy and was found to have invasive carcinoma of the left breast.  The patient was elected to have a left modified radical mastectomy, she was not interested in a partial mastectomy.  She is aware of the risks and complications of surgery, and wished to proceed.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  
The patient was taken to the operating room.  She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic.  The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well.  The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast.  The plain incision was marked along the skin.  Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site.  The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia.  Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle.  The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla.  The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out.  Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____.  The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection.  Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures.  After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding.  Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips.  Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps.  The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips.  The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures.  Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed.  The patient went to the recovery room in stable condition.

PROCEDURE: 
 Right L5-S1 intralaminar epidural steroid injection with 120 mg of Depo-Medrol under fluoroscopic guidance.


INDICATION: 
 The patient is a 51-year-old female with back pain referring into the right leg.


RISKS VERSUS BENEFITS: 
 The risks and benefits were discussed with the patient prior to the procedure.  She agrees to accept the risks and signs a written consent to proceed with the procedure.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was placed prone on the table.  The skin was thoroughly cleansed with Betadine swabs x3 and wiped off with a sterile gauze.  The subcutaneous intramuscular and interligamentous region was anesthetized with 4% lidocaine.

A 3-1/2-inch 20-gauge Tuohy catheter was directed under intermittent fluoroscopic guidance at the lamina.  Once the lamina was detected, the catheter was directed cephalad and medially and loss of resistance technique was used to determine the epidural space.


EPIDUROGRAM: 
 Omnipaque 300 1.5 mL was placed just to the right of the midline.  This was viewed on the AP and lateral projections.  It showed typical epidural spread pattern with good cephalad and caudad flow, and the flow was unrestricted.

Depo-Medrol 120 mg along with an additional bacteriostatic normal saline for a total of 60 mL injected solution was placed just to the right of the midline at L5-S1.

The patient tolerated the procedure well without procedural complications.  She will follow up with me in the office in the next few weeks to monitor her response to the injection.

REASON FOR EVALUATION: 
 The patient is a 37-year-old white single male admitted to the hospital through the emergency room.  I had seen him the day before in my office and recommended him to go into the hospital.  He had just come from a trip to Taho in Nevada and he became homicidal while there.  He started having thoughts about killing his mother.  He became quite frightened by that thought and called me during the weekend we were able to see him on that Tuesday after talking to him.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 This is a patient that has been suffering from a chronic psychotic condition now for a number of years.  He began to have symptoms when he was approximately 18 or 19 with auditory and visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions.  He was using drugs and smoking marijuana at that time has experimenting with LXV and another drugs too.  The patient has not used any drugs since age 25.  However, he has continued having intense and frequent psychotic bouts.  I have seen him now for approximately one year.  He has been quite refractory to treatment.  We tried different types of combination of medications, which have included Clozaril, Risperdal, lithium, and Depakote with partial response and usually temporary.  The patient has had starting with probably has had some temporary relief of the symptoms and they usually do not last more than a few days.  The dosages that we have used have been very high.  He has been on Clozaril 1200 mg combined with Risperdal up to 9 mg and lithium at a therapeutic level.  However, he has not responded.

He has delusions of antichrist.  He strongly believes that the dogs have a home in the neighborhood are communicating with him and criticizing him and he believes that all the people can communicate to him with telepathy including the animals.  He has paranoid delusions.  He also gets homicidal like prior to this admission.


PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:
  As mentioned before, this patient has been psychotic off and on for about 20 years now.  He has had years in which he did better on Clozaril and also his other medications.

With typical anti-psychotics, he has done well at times, but he eventually gets another psychotic bout.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 He has a history of obesity and also of diabetes mellitus.  However, most recently, he has not been treated for diabetes since his last regular weight since he stopped taking Zyprexa.  The patient has chronic bronchitis.  He smokes cigarettes constantly up to 60 a day.


DRUG HISTORY:
  He stopped using drugs when he was 25.  He has got a lapse, but he was more than 10 years and he has been clean ever since then.  As mentioned before, he smokes cigarettes quite heavily and which has been a problem for his health since he also has chronic bronchitis.


PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS: 
 The patient lives with his mother and has been staying with her for a few years now.  We have talked to her.  She is very supportive.  His only sister is also very supportive of him.  He has lived in the ABCD houses in the past.  He has done poorly in some of them.


MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION:
  The patient appeared alert, oriented to time, place, and person.  His affect is flat.  He talked about auditory hallucinations, which are equivocal in nature.  He is not homicidal in the hospital as he was when he was at home.  His voice and speech are normal.  He believes in telepathy.  His memory appears intact and his intelligence is calculated as average.


INITIAL DIAGNOSES:

AXIS I:  Schizophrenia.
AXIS II:  Deferred.
AXIS III:  History of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and chronic bronchitis.
AXIS IV:  Moderate.
AXIS V:  GAF of 35 on admission.


INITIAL TREATMENT AND PLAN:
  Since, the patient has been on high dosages of medications, we will give him a holiday and a structured environment.  We will put him on benzodiazepines and make a decision anti-psychotic later.  We will make sure that he is safe and that he addresses his medical needs well.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Bilateral axillary masses, rule out recurrent Hodgkin's disease.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  
Bilateral axillary masses, rule out recurrent Hodgkin's disease.


PROCEDURE PERFORMED:

1.  Left axillary dissection with incision and drainage of left axillary mass.
2.  Right axillary mass excision and incision and drainage.


ANESTHESIA: 
 LMA.


SPECIMENS:
  Left axillary mass with nodes and right axillary mass.


ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  
Less than 30 cc.


INDICATION: 
 This 56-year-old male presents to surgical office with history of bilateral axillary masses.  Upon evaluation, it was noted that the patient has draining bilateral masses with the left mass being approximately 8 cm in diameter upon palpation and the right being approximately 4 cm in diameter.  The patient had been continued on antibiotics preoperatively.  The patient with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma approximately 18 years ago and underwent therapy at that time and he was declared free of disease since that time.  Consent for possible recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma warranted exploration and excision of these masses.  The patient was explained the risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained.


GROSS FINDINGS: 
 Upon dissection of the left axillary mass, the mass was removed in toto and noted to have a cavity within it consistent with an abscess.

No loose structures were identified and sent for frozen section, which upon intraoperative consultation with Pathology Department revealed no obvious evidence of lymphoma, however, the confirmed pathology report is pending at this time.  The right axillary mass was excised without difficulty without requiring full axillary dissection.


PROCEDURE: 
 The patient was placed in supine position after appropriate anesthesia was obtained and a sterile prep and drape complete.  A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision about the mass itself extending this incision further to aid in the mobilization of the mass.  Sharp dissection was utilized with Metzenbaum scissors about the mass to maintain the injury to the skin structure and upon showing out the mass, Bovie electrocautery was utilized adjacent to the wall structure to maintain hemostasis.  Identification of the axillary anatomy was made and care was made to avoid injury to nerve, vessel or musculature.  Once this mass was removed in toto, lymph node structures were as well delivered with this mass and sent to frozen section as well the specimen was sent to gram stain and culture.  Upon revaluation of the incisional site, it was noted to be hemostatic.  Warm lap sponge was then left in place at this site.  Next, attention was turned to the right axilla where a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a 4 cm incision about the mass including the cutaneous structures involved with the erythematous reaction.  This was as well removed in toto and sent to Pathology for gram stain and culture as well as pathologic evaluation.  This site was then made hemostatic as well with the aid of Bovie electrocautery and approximation of the deep dermal tissues after irrigation with warm saline was then done with #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by #4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Attention was returned back left axilla, which upon re-exploration was noted to be hemostatic and a #7 mm JP was then introduced making a skin stab inferior to the incision and bringing the end of the drain through this incision.  This was placed within the incision site, ________ drainage of the axillary potential space.  Approximation of the deep dermal tissues were then done with #3-0 Vicryl in an interrupted technique followed by #4-0 Vicryl with running subcuticular technique.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  JP bulb was then placed to suction and sterile dressings were applied to both axilla.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a stable condition.  He will be discharged to home upon ability of the patient to have pain tolerance with Vicodin 1-2 as needed every six hours for pain and continue on Keflex antibiotics until gram stain culture proves otherwise.

REASON FOR REFERRAL:
  The patient is a 76-year-old Caucasian gentleman who works full-time as a tax attorney.  He was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after a recent hospitalization for possible transient ischemic aphasia.  Two years ago, a similar prolonged confusional spell was reported as well.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.


RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: 
 Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.


HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: 
 The patient was brought to the Hospital Emergency Department on 09/30/09 after experiencing an episode of confusion for which he has no recall the previous day.  He has no recollection of the event.  The following information is obtained from his medical record.  On 09/29/09, he reportedly went to a five-hour meeting and stated several times &quot;I do not feel well&quot; and looked &quot;glazed.&quot;  He does not remember anything from midmorning until the middle of the night and when his wife came home, she found him in bed at 6 p.m., which is reportedly unusual.  She thought he was warm and had chills.  He later returned to his baseline.  He was seen by Dr. X in the hospital on 09/30/09 and reported to him at that time that he felt that he had returned entirely to baseline.  His neurological exam at that time was unremarkable aside from missing one of three items on recall for the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  Due to mild memory complaints from himself and his wife, he was referred for more extensive neuropsychological testing.  Note that reportedly when his wife found him in bed, he was shaking and feeling nauseated, somewhat clammy and kept saying that he could not remember anything and he was repeating himself, asking the same questions in an agitated way, so she brought him to the emergency room.  The patient had an episode two years ago of transient loss of memory during which he was staring blankly while sitting at his desk at work and the episode lasted approximately two hours.  He was hospitalized at Hospital at that time as well and evaluation included negative EEG, MRI showing mild atrophy, and a neurological consultation, which did not result in a specific diagnosis, but during this episode he was also reportedly nauseous.  He was also reportedly amnestic for this episode.

In 2004, he had a sense of a funny feeling in his neck and electrodes in his head and had an MRI at that time which showed some small vessel changes.

During this interview, the patient reported that other than a coworker noticing a few careless errors in his completion of some documents and his wife reporting some mild memory changes that he had not noticed any significant decline.  He thought that his memory abilities were similar to those of his peers of his same age.  When I asked about this episode, he said he had no recall of it at all and that he &quot;felt fine the whole time.&quot;  He appeared to be somewhat questioning of the validity of reports that he was amnestic and confused at that time.  So, The patient reported some age related &quot;memory lapses&quot; such as going into a room and forgetting why, sometimes putting something down and forgetting where he had put it.  However, he reported that these were entirely within normal expectations and he denied any type of impairment in his ability to continue to work full-time as a tax attorney other than his wife and one coworker, he had not received any feedback from his children or friends of any problems.  He denied any missed appointments, any difficulty scheduling and maintaining appointments.  He does not have to recheck information for errors.  He is able to complete tasks in the same amount of time as he always has.  He reported that he has not made additional errors in tasks that he completed.  He said he does write everything down, but has always done things that way.  He reported that he works in a position that requires a high level of attentiveness and knowledge and that will become obvious very quickly if he was having difficulties or making mistakes.  He did report some age related changes in attention as well, although very mild and he thought these were normal and not more than he would expect for his age.  He remains completely independent in his ADLs.  He denied any difficulty with driving or maintaining any activities that he had always participated in.  He is also able to handle their finances.  He did report significant stress recently particularly in relation to his work environment.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  Includes coronary artery disease, status post CABG in 1991, radical prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy for the same cancer, hypertension, lumbar surgery done twice previously, lumbar stenosis many years ago in the 1960s and 1970s, now followed by Dr. Y with another lumbar surgery scheduled to be done shortly after this evaluation, and hyperlipidemia.  Note that due to back pain, he had been taking Percocet daily prior to his hospitalization.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 
 Celebrex 200 mg, levothyroxine 0.025 mg, Vytorin 10/40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, Coreg 10 mg, glucosamine with chondroitin, prostate 2.2, aspirin 81 mg, and laxative stimulant or stool softener.  Note that medical records say that he was supposed to be taking Lipitor 40 mg, but it is not clear if he was doing so and also there was no specific reason found for why he was taking the levothyroxine.


OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Surgical history is significant for hernia repair in 2007 as well.  The patient reported drinking an occasional glass of wine approximately two days of the week.  He quit smoking cigarettes 25 to 30 years ago and he was diagnosed with cancer.  He denied any illicit drug use.  Please add that his prostatectomy was done in 1993 and nephrectomy in 1983 for carcinoma.  He also had right carpal tunnel surgery in 2005 and has cholelithiasis.  Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient's sleep deprived EEG was recommended.

MRI completed on 09/30/09 showed &quot;mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy with no significant interval change from a prior study dated June 15, 2007.  No evidence of acute intracranial processes identified.  CT scan was also unremarkable showing only mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.  EEG was negative.  Deferential diagnosis was transient global amnesia versus possible seizure disorder.  Note that he also reportedly has some hearing changes, but has not followed up with an evaluation for hearing aid.


FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY:
 Reportedly significant for TIAs in his mother, although the patient did not report this during our evaluation and so that she had no memory problems or dementia when she passed away of old age at the age of 85.  In addition, his father had a history of heart disease and passed away at the age of 75.  He has one sister with diabetes and thought his mom might have had diabetes as well.


SOCIAL HISTORY:
  The patient obtained a law degree from the University of Baltimore.  He did not complete his undergraduate degree from the University of Maryland because he was able to transfer his credits in order to attend law school at that time.  He reported that he did not obtain very good grades until he reached law school, at which point he graduated in the top 10 of his class and had no problem passing the Bar.  He thought that effort and motivation were important to his success in his school and he had not felt very motivated previously.  He reported that he repeated math classes &quot;every year of school&quot; and attended summer school every year due to that.  He has worked as a tax attorney for the past 48 years and reported having a thriving practice with clients all across the country.  He served also in the U.S.  Coast Guard between 1951 and 1953.  He has been married for the past 36 years to his wife, Linda, who is a homemaker.  They have four children and he reported having good relationship with them.  He described being very active.  He goes for dancing four to five times a week, swims daily, plays golf regularly and spends significant amounts of time socializing with friends.


PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: 
 The patient denied any history of psychological or psychiatric treatment.  He reported that some stressors occasionally contribute to mildly low mood at this time, but that these are transient.

BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:  
His wife arrived unaccompanied and on time for his appointment.  He was well-dressed and groomed and appeared younger than his stated age.  He ambulated independently and no gross psychomotor abnormalities were apparent.  Eye contact was good.  Speech was normal with respects to rate, rhythm, and paucity.  Receptive language abilities appeared to be good as he was able to appropriately respond to the examiner's questions and instructions.  Thought processes were linear and goal-directed and no thought disturbances were noted.  Mood appeared to be euthymic.  Affect was appropriate and full range.

Vision and hearing appeared to be appropriate for the evaluation, although as noted, he apparently has some mild decline in his hearing that has not been addressed or evaluated.  Overall, he was very friendly and rapport was very easily developed.

He appeared to put full effort into all tasks and thus these results are thought to be an accurate reflection of his current cognitive functioning.  Premorbid intellectual functioning; based on a word reading test, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the superior range.  He was notably impulse throughout the evaluation, as he would often try to begin a task before the examiner had completed providing instructions.


COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING:  
The patient was performed within the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning assessing his performance across several domains including attention, visuospatial construction, memory conceptualization and initiation or perseveration.  He performed within normal limits on all these domains.


ATTENTION: 
 Passive and active auditory attention fell in the average range as he was able to accurately repeat six digits in forward sequence and five digits in backward sequence.  Visual working memory was in the high average range.  On a test of sustained attention for visual stimuli, he demonstrated high rate of accuracy despite the fact that there was mild decreases in consistency of his responses as the task progressed and at different interstimulus intervals.  Overall, however, these results appear to be well within normal limits.  Thus taken together the patient's auditory and nonverbal attentional abilities, all fell within normal limits and did not suggest significant decline from premorbid levels.


LANGUAGE: 
 Confrontation naming was strong and in the high average range.  He demonstrated good comprehension for verbal instructions.  He made a few very mild errors on a sentence repetition task, which may have been due to mild hearing problems.  The errors did not appear to be of clinical significance.  Rapid verbal retrieval fell in the average range for both phonemic and semantic cues well within broad normal limits.  This result may have represented a mild weakness relative to his estimated premorbid functioning.  Thus taken together, language abilities generally fell within the expected range, although mild weaknesses were seen in verbal fluency.


VISUOSPATIAL PERCEPTION AND CONSTRUCTION: 
 Visuospatial perception appeared to be within broad normal limits, although his construction and copy of visual figures was quite sloppy and imprecise.


LEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS:



VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY: 
 On a contextual memory task (i.e. stories), the patient performed within the average range immediately following story presentation, as well as following a delay.  His recognition of story details was in the low average range.  When given a large amount of seemingly unorganized information (i.e.  16-item list), The patient's initial ability to recall five-items immediately following presentation was in the average range.  He benefited significantly from repetition as he was able to recall 10 items following the second presentation and following a fifth presentation, he was able to successfully recall 13 of the 16 items (superior).  When immediately provided with a second list of 16-items, he was only able to recall three items immediately following presentation (low average).  His recall of the first list following short and long delays was in the average range.  Delayed recognition was also average.

Of note, during his recalls, he made a large number of repetition errors suggesting some difficulty with self-monitoring of his responses.  He also did not recognize and apply any organizational strategy.  Taken together, The patient's performance across measures of verbal learning and memory fell within broad normal limits relative to others of same age.  However, given his very high level of premorbid functioning, his performance suggested some mild weaknesses in encoding and retrieval that he is generally able to overcome with repetition of information.

He also appeared to have some difficulty organizing and monitoring his responses and difficulty with learning multiple simultaneous streams of information.


NON-VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY:  
The patient's immediate recall of visual designs was in the borderline range.  However, he retained most of the information that he initially learned following a delay and his performance fell in the low average range.  Recognition was average.  Taken together, these results again suggest that he had difficulties with encoding and retrieval of nonverbal information.  However, he was able to retain most of the reduced amount of information that he had initially learned.


EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING: 
 As mentioned, initiation and verbal fluency fell in the average range.  It is mildly weaker than expected given The patient's strong premorbid functioning.  He was also noted to make a number of repetition errors on this task.  Cognitive set shifting was generally within expected limits and in the average to high average range.  He was able to successfully inhibit a prepotent response.  On a task assessing cognitive flexibility inductive reasoning and the ability to use feedback in order to correct an ongoing response, The patient was noted to be quite impulsive and had difficulty conceptualizing alternate means to apply strategies in order to determine the correct answer and appeared to be somewhat distracted by nonessential information.  As mentioned above, he had a number of repetitions and difficulty organizing information meaningfully on memory tasks.  Taken together, these results suggest mild weaknesses in aspects of frontal lobe functioning.


MOTOR FUNCTIONING:  
The patient performed in the average range with both of his right dominant hand and left nondominant hand on a speeded fine motor coordination task.


EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING: 
 On an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only four items, which suggested that he was bothered by thoughts he could not get out of his head, often felt helpless, felt downhearted and blue and that his mind was not as clear as it used to be.  Overall, these results fell within normal limits and suggest that he is not currently experiencing a clinical level of depressive symptoms.


SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS: 
 The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation due to possible changes in memory.  He has a history of two episodes of confusion and amnesia, the most recent of which occurred in September 2009 with differential diagnosis including seizure disorder versus transient global amnesia.  On this comprehensive evaluation, the patient demonstrated mild weaknesses relative to his very high level of premorbid functioning on tasks assessing memory and executive functioning.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 
 Breast mass, left.


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
  Breast mass, left.


PROCEDURE:
  Excision of left breast mass.


OPERATION: 
 After obtaining an informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room where he underwent general endotracheal anesthesia.  The time-out process was followed.  Preoperative antibiotic was given.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  The mass was identified adjacent to the left nipple.  It was freely mobile and it did not seem to hold the skin.  An elliptical skin incision was made over the mass and carried down in a pyramidal fashion towards the pectoral fascia.  The whole of specimen including the skin, the mass, and surrounding subcutaneous tissue and fascia were excised en bloc.  Hemostasis was achieved with the cautery.  The specimen was sent to Pathology and the tissues were closed in layers including a subcuticular suture of Monocryl.  A small pressure dressing was applied.

Estimated blood loss was minimal and the patient who tolerated the procedure very well was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.

PATIENT PROFILE: 
 This is a 44-year-old female.  The patient reports greatly increasing pain over the past several weeks.  In addition, the patient has associated radicular symptoms of aching, radiating to the L3 dermatome distribution and L4 dermatome distribution.  She is status post posterior fusion and lumbar decompression within the past several years.  Due to the nature of the patient's persistent pain, epidural steroid injection is recommended.  The alternatives, benefits, and risks were discussed with the patient.  The patient verbalized understanding of the risks as well as the alternatives and wished to proceed with the procedure.  A signed and witnessed informed consent was placed on the chart.


PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS:
  Left leg pain, Left leg weakness, Left L3-4 radicular pain, Left L4-5 radicular pain, Lumbar spondylosis.


POST-OP DIAGNOSIS:
  Left leg pain, Left leg weakness, Left L3-4 radicular pain, Left, L4-5 radicular pain, Lumbar spondylosis.


ANESTHESIA:
  Midazolam 2 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.


FINDINGS:


PAIN MANAGEMENT:
  The patient reports greatly increasing pain over the past several weeks.  The patient now rates pain as 8/10.  The reported pain is at L3-4 and L4-5.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
  The patient was placed in the prone position on the radiolucent operating table.  The lumbar area was prepped and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion.  The left L3-L4 level was identified for a transforaminal epidural injection and the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue were anesthetized.  A 22 gauge 3.5 inch B-bevel spinal needle was passed through the skin wheal and advanced in a ventral direction until the tip of the needle was properly placed in the left superior posterior intervertebral foramen as confirmed by AP and lateral fluoroscopic views.  No blood was aspirated.  There was no CSF flow.  Following negative aspiration, 1 mL Isovue-M200 was injected to produce the epidurogram.  There was appropriate needle placement and no intravascular or intrathecal flow.  1 mL of a 40 mg/mL solution of Kenalog and 1 mL of 1% Lidocaine was injected.

Attention was then turned to the next injection.  The lumbar area was prepped and draped in the appropriate sterile fashion.  The left L4-L5 level was identified for a transforaminal epidural injection and a skin wheal was made at the spinal needle entry site.  A 22 gauge 3.5 inch spinal needle was passed through the skin wheal and advanced in a ventral direction until the tip of the needle was properly placed in the left superior posterior intervertebral foramen as confirmed by AP and lateral fluoroscopic views.  No blood was aspirated.  There was no CSF flow.  Following negative aspiration 1 mL Isovue-M200 was injected to produce the epidurogram.  There was appropriate needle placement and no intravascular or intrathecal flow.  1 mL of a 40 mg/mL solution of Kenalog and 1 mL of 1% Lidocaine was injected.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.


DRAINS / DRESSING:
  Applied sterile dressing including BAND-AID.


PATIENT TO RECOVERY ROOM: 
 The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was brought to the recovery room in excellent condition.


COMPLICATIONS: 
 No immediate complications

CERVICAL SELECTIVE NERVE ROOT BLOCK



PREPROCEDURE PREPARATION:
  After being explained the risks and benefits of the procedure, the patient signed the standard informed consent form.  The patient was placed in the prone position and standard ASA monitors applied.  Intravenous access was established and IV sedation was used.  For further details of IV sedation and infusion, please refer to anesthesia notes.  The patient was able to respond appropriately throughout the procedure.  * Fluoroscopy was used to identify the appropriate anatomy.  The skin was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion and sterile technique was maintained throughout the procedure.


PROCEDURE DETAILS:
  The patient was laid supine.  Oblique placement was achieved by placing pillow below the shoulder and turning the head.  The C# neural foramina was identified by counting down from the C2-3 foramen.  The external carotid artery was marked off by palpation.  The neck was aseptically prepared.  1% lidocaine was used for local infiltration and subsequently a 25-gauge spinal needle was passed down to the C# neural foramen under fluoroscopic control.  The posterior inferior edge of the foramen bone was contacted.  The needle was then redirected and slowly walked off the bone into the foramen by a few millimeters.  Care was taken to remain in the posterior inferior edge of the foramen.  Positioning was checked by AP view, in which the needle tip extended no further medially than the midpoint of the adjacent pedicle.  1 mL of contrast was used to confirm position under fluoroscopy after aspiration.  Acceptable dye pattern was seen.  Subsequent 1 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected after aspiration and the patient was monitored.  No adverse affects with 1% lidocaine were noted and subsequently 1 mL of Celestone was injected.  Compression bandage was applied to the neck and no complications were noted.


POSTPROCEDURE EVALUATION:
  After a 30-minute recovery period, during which no complications were noted, the patient was discharged home.  Pulse oximetry was carried out on room air in recovery and all oxygen saturations were above 95% with no respiratory distress observed.

REASON FOR CONSULT: 
 I was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior ST-elevation MI.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion.  Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month.  The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m.  At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements.  Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve.  Then, she began vomiting.  When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.

She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI.  I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG.  She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free.  Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 
 Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.  In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage.  We did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion.  She is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple CVA.


MEDICATIONS: 
 Medications as an outpatient:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.
2.  Roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain.


ALLERGIES:  
CODEINE.  NO SHRIMP, SEAFOOD, OR DYE ALLERGY.


FAMILY HISTORY: 
 Negative for cardiac disease.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 She does not smoke cigarettes.  She uses alcohol.  No use of illicit drugs.  She is divorced and lives with her daughter.  She is a retired medical librarian from Florida.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
Unable to be obtained due to the patient's aphasia.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 Height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22.  O2 saturation 100%.  On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization.  HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic.  She has dry mucosal membrane.  She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new.  Neck veins are not distended.  No carotid bruits visible.  Skin:  Warm, well perfused.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  Cardiac exam:  S1, S2, regular rate.  No significant murmurs.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended.  Extremities:  Without edema, on limited exam.  Neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop.


DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA: 
 EKGs as reviewed above.  Her last ECG shows normalization of prior ST elevation in the inferior leads with Q waves and first-degree AV block, PR interval 280 milliseconds.  Further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, INR 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179.

Chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion.


IMPRESSION: 
 The patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized.  I will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of.


RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  I think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.
2.  Morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.
3.  Would avoid other blood thinners including Plavix, Integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion.

Other management as per the medical service.  I have discussed the case with Dr. X of the hospitalist service who will be admitting the patient.

ADMITTING DIAGNOSES:

1.  Respiratory distress.
2.  Reactive airways disease.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

1.  Respiratory distress.
2.  Reactive airways disease.
3.  Pneumonia.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
 The patient is a 3-year-old boy previously healthy who has never had a history of asthma or reactive airways disease who presented with a 36-hour presentation of URI symptoms, then had an abrupt onset of cough and increased work of breathing.  Child was brought to Children's Hospital and received nebulized treatments in the ER and the Hospitalist Service was contacted regarding admission.  The patient was seen and admitted through the emergency room.

He was placed on the hospitalist system and was started on continuous nebulized albuterol secondary to his respiratory distress.  He also received inhaled as well as systemic corticosteroids.  An x-ray was without infiltrate on initial review by the hospitalist, but there was a right upper lobe infiltrate versus atelectasis per the official radiology reading.  The patient was not started on any antibiotics and his fever resolved.  However, the CRP was relatively elevated at 6.7.  The CBC was normal with a white count of 9.6; however, the bands were 84%.  Given these results, which she is to treat the pneumonia as bacterial and discharge the child with amoxicillin and Zithromax.

He was taken off of continuous and he was not on room air all night.  In the morning, he still had some bilateral wheezing, but no tachypnea.


DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 
GENERAL:  No acute distress, running around the room.

HEENT:  Oropharynx moist and clear.

NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly or masses.

CHEST:  Bilateral basilar wheezing.  No distress.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs noted.  Well perfused peripherally.

ABDOMEN:  Bowel sounds present.  The abdomen is soft.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly, no masses.  Nontender to palpation.

GENITOURINARY:  Deferred.

EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well perfused.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
  As follows:

EXAM:
  Nuclear medicine lymphatic scan.


REASON FOR EXAM: 
 Left breast cancer.


TECHNIQUE: 
 1.0 mCi of Technetium-99m sulfur colloid was injected within the dermis surrounding the left breast biopsy site at four locations.  A 16-hour left anterior oblique imaging was performed with and without shielding of the original injection site.


FINDINGS:  
There are two small foci of increased activity in the left axilla.  This is consistent with the sentinel lymph node.  No other areas of activity are visualized outside of the injection site and two axillary lymph nodes.


IMPRESSION:  
Technically successful lymph node injection with two areas of increased activity in the left axilla consistent with sentinel lymph node.

REFERRAL QUESTIONS:
  Mr. Abcd was referred for psychological assessment by his primary medical provider, to help clarify his diagnosis, especially with respect to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a depression, or a Bipolar Spectrum Disorder.  The information will be used for treatment planning.


BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
  Mr. Abcd is a 33-year-old married man who lives with his wife and three children.  He has been married since 1995 and lost a son to SIDS over seven years ago.  He served in the army for two years, and did attend some college at UAA.  He still wants to get a degree in engineering.  Mr. Abcd indicated that he did use THC at the time of his initial intake with me in January 2006, but there are no other substance abuse issues as an adult so far as I am aware.  He has had multiple stressors, including a bankruptcy in 2000, as well as his wife's significant health problems.  He also reported having herniated discs incurred in an injury over a year ago.  He has received counseling in the past, and did try both Lexapro and Wellbutrin, which he stopped taking in October 2005.  He indicated these medications tended to decrease libido and flatten all of his emotions.  He indicated that he thought he might have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but that this had not been formally evaluated or treated.  There is no reported bipolar illness in his immediate family, but there is some depression.  A recent stressor involved OCS involvement, apparently because his infant child tested positive for THC.  So far as I am aware, this case is closed at this time.  


BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:
  Mr. Abcd arrived on time for his testing session dressed casually and with good hygiene and grooming.  Mood is reported to be generally okay, though with some stress.  Affect was bright and appropriate to the situation.  Speech was a little pressured, but was of normal content and was at all times coherent and goal directed.  He was a very pleasant and cooperative testing subject, who appeared to give a good effort on the tasks requested of him.  The results appear to provide a useful sample of his current attitudes, opinions, and functional levels in the areas assessed.


ASSESSMENT RESULTS:
  Mr. Abcd's responses to a brief self-report instrument given to him by Dr. Starks was suggestive of symptoms that could be consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  I therefore had him complete the Conners CPT-II, which showed good performance and no indications of attention problems.  The Confidence Index associated with ADHD was over 58 percent that no clinical attention problems are present.  While a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should not unequivocally be ruled out based on the results of this test, there is nothing in the CPT-II measures indicating attention problems, and that diagnosis appears to be unlikely.  The MMPI-2 profile is a technically valid and interpretable one.  The Modified Welsh Code is as follows:  49+86-231/570:  F'+-/:LK#.  The high F scale may reflect some moodiness, restlessness, dissatisfaction, and changeableness in his typical behavior.  The Basic Clinical Profile is similar to persons who tend to get into trouble for violating social norms and rules.  Such persons are more likely to experience conflicts with authority.  They also are prone to impulsivity, self-indulgence, problems with delay of gratification, exercise problematic judgment, and often have low frustration tolerance.  Those with similar scores tend to be moody, irritable, extraverted, and often do not trust others very much.  Mr. Abcd may tend to keep others at a distance, yet feel rather insecure and dependent.  A bipolar diagnosis is a possibility, and an antisocial personality disorder cannot be entirely ruled out either, though I am less confident that that is correct.  The MMPI-2 Content Scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors, and the Supplementary Scales has a single clinical elevation on Addiction Admission, which is entirely consistent with his interview data.  Posttraumatic stress scales are not elevated at a clear clinical level on the MMPI-2.


SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
   Mr. Abcd certainly has multiple stressors in his life, and I suspect that some of his reported attention and concentration difficulties are more related to those problems than to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  Conners CPT-II results do not provide support for that diagnosis, and in the absence of other data, I would tend to rule out ADHD at this time.  The MMPI-2 profile indicates some problems with impulsivity, family stressors, and mild depressive symptoms.  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder scales do not reach clinical significance.  The profile suggests some impulsivity, restlessness, moodiness, irritability, problems with frustration tolerance, poor decision making, and potential conflicts with authority.  A Bipolar Spectrum Disorder diagnosis is a possibility and I would recommend exploring treatment options to further examine and address this.  An antisocial personality disorder may be present, or traits of antisocial personality may be present, but at this point, I do not see sufficient evidence to warrant that diagnosis.

REASON FOR REFERRAL:  
The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of Children's Hospital after he was hospitalized for what eventually was diagnosed as a conversion disorder.  I had met the patient and his mother in the hospital and had begun getting information regarding his symptoms and background at that time.  After his discharge, the patient was scheduled to see me for followup services.  This was a 90-minute intake that was completed on 10/10/2007 with the patient's mother.  I reviewed with her the treatment consent form as well as the boundaries of confidentiality, and she stated that she understood these concepts.


PRESENTING PROBLEMS:
  Please see the inpatient hospital progress note contained in his chart for additional background information.  The patient's mother reported that he continues with his conversion episodes.  She noted that they are occurring approximately 6 times a day.  They consist primarily of tremors, arching his back, and, by her report, doing some gang signs during the episode.  She reported that the conversion reactions had decreased after his hospitalization, and he had none for 3 days, but then, they began picking up again.  From information gathered from mother, it would suggest that she frequently does &quot;status checks,&quot; where she asks him how he is doing, and that after she began checking on him more that he began having more conversion reactions.  In terms of what she does when he has a conversion reaction, she reported that primarily that she tries to keep him safe.  She puts a sheath under him because the carpeting is dirty.  She removes any furniture, she wraps his legs together so they do not knock together, she sits with him and she gives him attention and says &quot;calm down, breathe&quot; and after it is over, she continues to tell him to be calm and to breathe.  She denied that she gives them any more attention.  I strongly encouraged her to stop doing status checks, as this likely is reinforcing the behavior.  I also noted that while he certainly needs to be kept safe, that she does not want to give a lot of attention to this behavior, and that over time we will teach him ways of coping with this independently.  In regards to his mood, she reported that his mood is quite good.  She denied any sadness or irritability.  She denied anhedonia.  She reports that he is a little bit hard to get up in the morning.  He is going to bed at about 11, getting up at 8 or 9.  No changes in weight or eating were noted.  No changes in concentration, suicidal ideation, and any suicidal history was denied.  She denied symptoms of anxiety, although she did note that she thought he worried a little about going to school and some financial stress.  Other symptoms of psychopathology were denied.


DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY: 
 The patient was reportedly a 7 pounds 12 ounces product of an unplanned and uncomplicated pregnancy and planned cesarean delivery.  Mother reported that she did receive prenatal care.  The use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco during the pregnancy were denied.  She denied that he had any feeding or sleeping problems in the perinatal period.  She described him as a fussy and active baby, but he was described as a cuddly baby.  She noted that the pediatricians never expressed any concerns regarding his developmental milestones.  SHE REPORTED THAT HE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.  Serious injures or toileting problems were denied as were a history of seizures.


FAMILY BACKGROUND: 
 The patient currently lives with his mother who is age 57 and with her partner who is age 40.  They have been together since 1994, and he is the only father figure that the patient has even known.  The father was previously in a relationship that resulted in an 11-year-old daughter who visits the patient's home every other weekend.  The patient's father's whereabouts are unknown.  There is no information on his family.  Mother stated that he discontinued his involvement in her life when she was about 3 months pregnant with the patient, and the patient has never met him.  As noted, there is no information on the paternal side of the family.  In terms of the mother's side of family, the maternal grandfather died in his 60s due to what mother described as &quot;hardening of the arteries,&quot; and the maternal grandmother died in 2003 due to stroke.  There were 4 maternal aunts, one of them died at age 9 months from pneumonia, one of them died at 19 years old from what was described as a brain tumor, and there are 3 maternal uncles.  In terms of family relationships, it was reported that overall the patient tends to get along fairly well with his parents, who reported that the patient and her partner tend to compete for mother's attention, and she noted this is difficult at times.  She reported that the patient and her partner do not really do anything together.  Mother reported that there is no domestic violence in the home, but there is some marital conflict, and this is may be difficult for The patient, as it is carried on in Spanish, and he does not speak Spanish.  There also is some stress in the home due to the stepdaughter, as there are some concerns that her mother may be involved in drugs.  The mother reported that she attended high school, did not attend any college.  She denied learning problems.  She denied psychological problems or any drug/alcohol history.  In terms of the biological father, she reported he did not graduate from high school.  She did not know of learning problems, psychological problems.  She denied that he had a drug/alcohol history.  There is a family history of alcoholism in one of the maternal uncles as well as in the maternal grandfather.  It should be noted that the patient and his family live in a small 4-bedroom apartment, where privacy is very difficult.


SOCIAL BACKGROUND:
  She reported that the patient is able to make and keep friends, but he enjoys lifting weights, skateboarding, and that he recently had an opportunity to do rock climbing, he really enjoyed that.  I encouraged her to have him involved in physical activity, as this is good for discharge the stress, to encourage the weightlifting, as well as the skateboarding.  Mother is going to check further information regarding the rock climbing that the patient had been involved in, which was at it sounds like by her description as some sort of boys' and girls' type of club.  Abuse of drugs or alcohol were denied.  The patient was not described as being sexually active.


ACADEMIC BACKGROUND: 
 The patient is currently in the 10th grade.  At present, he is on independent studies, which began after his hospitalization.  The mother reported that the teacher, who had come to school saw one of his episodes, and stated that, they would not want him to be attending school.  I spoke with her very clearly and directly regarding the fact that it was probably not best for the patient to be on independent studies, that he needed to be returned to his normal school environment.  He has never had an episode at school, and he needs to be back with his peers, back in a regular environment, where he is under normal expectations.  I spoke with her regarding my concerns, regarding the fact that he is unsupervised during the day, and we do not want this turning into one big long vacation, where he is not getting his work done, and he gets himself in trouble.  Normally, he would be attending at High School.  The mother stated that she would contact them as well as check into possibly a 504-Plan.  She reported that he really does not to go back to High School.  He says, the &quot;kids are bad;&quot; however, she denied that he has any history of fighting.  She noted that he is stressed by the school, there have been some peer problems, possibly some bullying.  I noted these need to be addressed with the school, as she had not done so.  She stated that she would speak with a counselor.  She noted, however, that he has a history of not liking school and avoiding going to school.  She noted that he is somewhat behind in his work due to the hospitalization.  His grades traditionally are C's.  She denied any Special Education Services.


PREVIOUS COUNSELING: 
 Denied.


DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION: 
 Similar to my impression at the hospital, it would appear that the patient clearly qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder.  It appears that there are multiple stressors in the family, and that the mother is reinforcing his conversion reaction.  I am also very concerned regarding the fact that he is not attending school and want him back in the normal school environment as quickly as possible.  My plan is to meet the patient at the next session to update the information regarding his functioning and to begin to teach him skills for reducing his stress and relaxing.


DSM-IV DIAGNOSES:  

AXIS I:  Conversion disorder (300.11).
AXIS II:  No diagnosis (V71.09).
AXIS III:  No diagnosis.
AXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group, educational problems, and peer problems.
AXIS V:  Global Assessment of Functioning equals 60.

OPERATION:
  Lumbar epidural steroid injection, intralaminar approach, seated position.


ANESTHESIA:
    Local and sedation.


COMPLICATIONS:  
  None.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
  The procedure risks, hazards and alternatives were discussed with the patient and a proper consent was obtained.  The patient was placed in a lateral decubitus position and monitored with an EKG, blood pressure cuff and pulse oximetry.  The skin was prepped and draped in the sterile classic fashion.  Excess cleansing solution was removed from the skin.  Local anesthesia infiltrated subcutaneous and deep at *.  An 18-gauge Tuohy needle was then placed in the epidural space utilizing a midline intralaminar approach with loss of resistance technique and a saline-filled syringe.  Once the epidural space was identified, a negative aspiration of the heme or CSF was done.  This was followed by an injection of 120 mg methylprednisolone acetate and normal saline in aliquots of 2, 3 and 3 cc.  Negative aspirations were done prior to each injection.  The needle was cleared with saline prior to its withdrawal.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any apparent difficulties or complications.

SUBJECTIVE: 
 I am following the patient today for immune thrombocytopenia.  Her platelets fell to 10 on 01/09/07 and shortly after learning of that result, I increased her prednisone to 60 mg a day.  Repeat on 01/16/07 revealed platelets up at 43.  No bleeding problems have been noted.  I have spoken with her hematologist who recommends at this point we decrease her prednisone to 40 mg for 3 days and then go down to 20 mg a day.  The patient had been on 20 mg every other day at least for a while, and her platelets hovered at least above 20 or so.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 
 Vitals:  As in chart.  The patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative.  She is in no apparent distress.  The petechial areas on her legs have resolved.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
 Patient with improvement of her platelet count on burst of prednisone.  We will decrease her prednisone to 40 mg for 3 days, then go down to 20 mg a day.  Basically thereafter, over time, I may try to sneak it back a little bit further.  She is on medicines for osteoporosis including bisphosphonate and calcium with vitamin D.  We will arrange to have a CBC drawn weekly.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
 Irritable baby with fever for approximately 24 hours.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
 This 6-week-old infant was doing well until about 48 hours prior to admission, developed irritability, fussiness, a little bit of vomiting, and then fever up to 103-degrees. The child was brought into the emergency room and a complete septic workup was done, and the child is being treated in a rule out sepsis protocol.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 This child was born by term pregnancy, spontaneous vaginal delivery, to a mother who was a teenager. He is bottle fed and he has had his hepatitis B vaccine. He lives in a home where there are smokers. This is his first illness.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
 He has had no previous surgeries.


MEDICATION (S):
 He takes no medications on a regular basis.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
 Positive for those things mentioned already in the past medical history and history of present illness.


FAMILY HISTORY:
 The family history is noncontributory.


SOCIAL HISTORY:
 This child lives with his mother and father, both are teenagers, unmarried, who are not well educated. Grandmother is a heavy smoker.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

VITAL SIGNS: The vital signs are stable, the patient is febrile at 101-degrees.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT/GENERAL: The anterior fontanelle is not bulging. The rest of the examination is within normal limits. The neck is supple, no nuchal rigidity noted, though this child is irritable and fussy, and whines and cries where ever you make touch him. He has an irritable disposition no matter what you do to him, and whines even while at rest.
HEART: The heart rate is rapid, but there was no murmur noted.
LUNGS: The lungs are clear.
ABDOMEN: The abdomen is without mass, distention, or visceromegaly.
GENITOURINARY/RECTAL: Examination within normal limits.
EXTREMITIES: The extremities are normal. No Kernig's or Brudzinski sign.
NEUROLOGIC: Cranial nerves II through XII are intact, no focal deficits. As I mentioned before, the child is extremely irritable, fussy, and has a great deal of general inconsolability.
SKIN: The child, in addition, has a skin pattern of cutis marmorata, which I think is a bit more exaggerated since the child is febrile and has some peripheral vasodilatation.


CLINICAL IMPRESSION (S):
 Likely viral syndrome, viral meningitis, flu syndrome.


PLAN:
 Continue the septic workup protocol, supportive care with IV fluids, and Tylenol as needed for fever, and continue the antibiotics until spinal fluid cultures and blood cultures are negative for 48 hours. In addition, I believe that the rapid heart rate is a sinus tachycardia, and is related to the child's illness, irritability, and his fever. In addition, there were no intracranial bruits noted.

EXAM: 
 Two views of the pelvis.


HISTORY:
  This is a patient post-surgery, 2-1/2 months.  The patient has a history of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) bilaterally.


TECHNIQUE: 
 Frontal and lateral views of the hip and pelvis were evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated MM/DD/YYYY.  Lateral view of the right hip was evaluated.


FINDINGS:
  Frontal view of the pelvis and a lateral view of the right hip were evaluated and correlated with the patient's most recent priors dated MM/DD/YYYY.  Current films reveal stable appearing post-surgical changes.  Again demonstrated is a single intramedullary screw across the left femoral neck and head.  There are 2 intramedullary screws through the greater trochanter of the right femur.  There is a lucency along the previous screw track extending into the right femoral head and neck.  There has been interval removal of cutaneous staples and/or surgical clips.  These were previously seen along the lateral aspect of the right hip joint.

Deformity related to the previously described slipped capital femoral epiphysis is again seen.


IMPRESSION:

1.  Stable-appearing right hip joint status-post pinning.
2.  Interval removal of skin staples as described above.

PROCEDURE: 
 Hip injection.


INFORMED CONSENT:  
The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient.  The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks.

The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications.  I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids.

The patient was informed both verbally and in writing.  The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed.


PROCEDURE:  
Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.  The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback.  The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine.

The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table.  The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine.  The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement.  Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the hip and the planned needle approach.  The femoral artery was located by palpation of the pulse.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned needle approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.  All injected medications were preservative free.  With fluoroscopy, a *** spinal needle was gently guided into the ***.  Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement.  Approximately *** nonionic contrast agent was injected under direct real-time fluoroscopic observation.  Correct needle placement was confirmed by production of an appropriate arthrogram without concurrent vascular dye pattern.  Finally, the treatment solution, consisting of ***.  All injected medications were preservative free.  Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure


COMPLICATIONS: 
 None.  No complications.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition.


DISCUSSION: 
 Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable.  The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day.  The patient was told to resume all medications.  The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities.

The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function.

Follow up appointment was made in approximately 1 week.

She has been on the medical floor for monitoring and is medically stable and was transferred to the psychiatric floor today.  The patient states she had been thinking about suicide for a couple of weeks.  Felt that her Huntington disease had worsened and she wanted to spare her family and husband from trouble.  Reports she has been not socializing with her family because of her worsening depression.  Husband notes that on Monday after speaking to Dr. X, they had been advised to alternate the patient's Pamelor (nortriptyline) to every other day because the patient was reporting dry mouth.  They did as they have instructed and husband feels this may have had some factor on her worsening depression.  The patient decided to ingest the pills when her husband went to work on Friday.  She thought Friday would be a good day because there would be less medical people working so her chances of receiving medical care would be lessened.  Her husband left around 7 in the morning and returned around 11 and found her sleeping.  About 30 minutes after his arrival, he found the empty bottles and woke up the patient to bring her to the hospital.

She says she wishes she would have died, but is happy she is alive and is currently not suicidal because she notes her sons may be have to be tested for the Huntington gene.  She does not clearly explain how this has made her suicidality subside.

This is the third suicide attempt in the last two months for this patient.  About two months ago, the patient took an overdose of Tylenol and some other medication, which the husband and the patient are not able to recall.  She was taken to Southwest Memorial Hermann Hospital.  A few weeks ago, the patient tried to shoot herself and the gun was fired and there is a blow-hole in the floor.  Husband locked the gun after that and she was taken to Bellaire Hospital.  The patient has had three psychiatric admissions in the past two months, two to Southwest Memorial and one to Bellaire Hospital for 10 days.  She sees Dr. X once or twice weekly.  He started seeing her after her first suicide attempt.

The patient's husband and the patient state that until March 2009, the patient was independent, was driving herself around and was socially active.  Since then she has had worsening of her Huntington symptoms including short-term memory loss.  At present, the patient could not operate the microwave or operate her cell phone and her husband says that she is progressively more withdrawn, complains about anxiety, and complains about shortness of breath.  The patient notes that she has had depressive symptoms of quitting social life, the patient being withdrawn for the past few months and excessive worry about her Huntington disease.

The patient's mother passed away 25 years ago from Huntington's.  Her grandmother passed away 50 years ago and two brothers also passed away of Huntington's.  The patient has told her husband that she does not want to go that way.  The patient denies auditory or visual hallucinations, denies paranoid ideation.  The husband and the patient deny any history of manic or hypomanic symptoms in the past.

REASON FOR REFERRAL: 
 The patient was referred to me by Dr. X of the Hospitalist Service at Children's Hospital due to a recent admission for pseudoseizures.  This was a 90-minute initial intake completed on 10/19/2007 with the patient's mother.  I have reviewed with her the boundaries of confidentiality and the treatment consent form, and she stated that she had understood these concepts.


PRESENTING PROBLEM: 
 It is reported that the patient was recently hospitalized and has been hospitalized in 2 occasions for pseudoseizure activity.  These were confirmed by video EEG and consist of trembling, shaking, and things of that nature.  She does have a history of focal seizures and perhaps simple seizures, which were diagnosed when she was 5 years old, but the seizure activity that was documented during the hospital stay is of a significant different quality.  I had met with them in the hospital and introduced myself and gathered some basic background information, but this is a supplement to that information, which is contained within this chart.  It was reported to me that she has been under considerable stress.  First of all, it should be noted that the patient is developmentally delayed.  Although she is 17 years old, she operates at about a fourth grade level.  Mother reported that The patient becomes stressed because she thinks that everyone is against her, that she cannot do anything unless someone is there, that she needs a lot of direction, that she gets confused easily, that she thinks that people become angry at her, that she misinterprets what people are saying and thinks that they are upset.  It is reported, the patient feels that her mother yells at her, and that is mad at her often.  It was reported that in addition she recently has had change in her visitation with her father, that she within the last 6 months, has started seeing her father every other weekend after he had been discharged from prison.  She reported that what is stress for her is that sometimes he does not always show up for visits or is late and that upsets her a lot and that she is upset when she has to leave him, also additional stressor is at school.  She reports that she has no friends that she feels unwanted and picked on.  She gets confused easily at school, worries about things, and believes that the teachers become angry with her.  In regards to her mood, mother reported that she is usually happy, unless things do not go her way, and then, she becomes upset and says that nobody cares about her.  She sits in the couch, she become angry, does not speak.  Mother sends her to her room, and she calms down, takes a couple of deep breaths, and that passes.  It is reported that the patient has &quot;always been this way&quot; and that is not a change in her behavior.  Mother did think that she did seem a little more depressed, that she seems more lonely.  Over the last few months, she has seemed a little bit more down because she does not have any friends and that she is bored.  Mother reported that she frequently complains of being bored, but has always been this way.  No sleep disturbance was noted.  No changes in weight.  No suicidal ideation.  No deficits in energy were noted.  Mother did report that she does tend to worry, but her worries tend to be because she gets confused, does not understand what she needs to do, and is quite rigid, but mother did not feel that the worry was actually affecting her functioning on a daily basis.


DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY:
  The patient was the 5 pound 12 ounce product of an unplanned pregnancy and normal spontaneous vaginal delivery.  She was delivered at 36 weeks' gestation.  Mother reported that she received prenatal care.  Difficulties during the pregnancy were denied.  The use of drugs, alcohol, tobacco during the pregnancy were denied.  No eating or sleeping difficulties during the perinatal period were reported.  Temperament was described as easy.  The patient is described as a cuddly baby.  In terms of serious injuries, they were denied.  Serious illnesses:  She has been diagnosed since age 5 with seizures.  Mother was not able to tell me the exact kind of seizures, but it would appear from I could gather that they are focal seizures and possibly simple-to-complex partial seizures.  The patient does not have a history of allergy or toileting problems.  She is currently taking Trileptal 450 mg b.i.d., and she is currently taking Depakote, although she is going to be weaned off the Depakote by her neurologist.  She is taking Prevacid and ibuprofen.  The neurologist that she sees is Dr. Y here at Children's Hospital.


FAMILY BACKGROUND:
  In terms of family background, the patient lives with her mother age 38 and her mother's partner, who is age 40, and with her 16-year-old sister who does not have any developmental delays.  Mother had been married to the patient's father, but they were together as a couple beginning 1990, married in 1997, separated in 2002, and divorced in 2003; he lives in the ABC area and visits them every other Saturday, but there are no overnight visits.  The paternal grandparents are both living here in California, but are separated.  They are 3 paternal uncles and 2 paternal aunts.

Mother's partner had been married previously; he has 2 children from that relationship, a 23-year-old, and a 20-year-old female, who really are not part of the patient's daily life.  In terms of other family background, it was reported that the mother's partner gets frustrated with The patient, does not completely understand the degree of her delay and how that may affect her ability to do things as well as her interpretation of things.  The sister was described as having some resentment towards her older sister, that she feels like she was just to watch out for her, care for her, and that sister has always wanted to follow her around and do the things that she does.  The biological father allegedly was in jail for a year due to drug possession.  Mother reported that he had a problem with methamphetamine.  In addition, she reported there is an accusation that he had molested their niece; however, she stated that there was a trial, and he was found to be not guilty of that.  She stated there was no evidence that he had ever molested the patient or her sister.  There had been quite a bit of chaos in the family when the mother and father were together.  There was a lot of arguing.  There were a lot of moves, there was domestic violence both from father to mother and mother to father consisting mostly of pushing and shoving by mother's report.  The patient did observe this.  After the separation, it was reported that there were continued difficulties that the father took the patient and her sister from school without mother's knowledge and had filed to get custody of them and actually ended up having custody of them for a month, and told the patient and her sister that the mother had abandoned them.  Mother reported that they went to court, and there was a court order giving the mother custody back after the father went to jail.  Mother stated that was approximately 5 years ago.  In terms of current, mother reports that she currently works 2 jobs from 8 to 5 on Monday and Friday and from 6 to 10 on Monday, Wednesday's, and Friday's, but she does have the weekends off.  The patient was reported also to have a job through her school on several weeknights.

Mother reported that she graduated from high school, had a year of college.  She was an average student, had learning difficulties in reading.  No psychological or drug or alcohol history was reported by mother.  In terms of the biological father, mother stated that he graduated from high school, had a couple of years of college, was a good student, no learning problems or psychological problems for him were reported.  Mother reported that he had a history of methamphetamine use.

Other psychiatric history in the family was denied.


SOCIAL HISTORY: 
 She reported that the patient feels like she does not have any friends, that she is lonely and bored, really does not do much for fun.  Her fun consists primarily of doing crafts with mother, sewing, painting, drawing, beadwork, and things like that.  It was reported that she really feels that she is bored and does not have much to do.


ACADEMIC BACKGROUND:  
The patient is in the 11th grade at High School.  She has 2 regular education classes, mother could not tell me what they were, but the rest of her classes are special education.  Mother could not tell me what her IQ was, although she noticed she works at about a 4th or 5th grade level.  Mother reported that the terminology most often used with the patient was developmental delay.  Her counselor's name is Mr. XYZ, but she reported that overall she is a good student, but she does have sometimes some difficulties at school, becoming upset or angry regarding the little things that she does not seem to understand.  It is reported that the patient feels that she has no friends at school that she is lonely, and that is she does not really care for school.  She reported that the patient is involved in a work program through the school where she works at Pet Extreme on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3 to 8 p.m. where she stocks shelves.  It is reported that she does not like to go to school because she feels like nobody likes her.  She is not involved in any kind of clubs or groups at school.  Mother reported that she is also not receiving CVRC services.


PREVIOUS COUNSELING: 
 Mother reported that she has been in counseling before, but mother could not give me any information about that, who did the counseling, or what it was about.  She does receive evidently some peer counseling at school because she gets upset and needs help in calming down.


DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION:
  It appears that the patient best qualifies for a diagnosis of conversion disorder, and information from Neurology suggests that the &quot;seizure episodes&quot; are not true seizures, but appear to be pseudoseizures.  The patient is experiencing quite bit of stress with a lot of changes in her life, also difficulty in functioning likely due to her developmental delay makes it difficult for her to understand.


PLAN:
  My plan is to meet with the patient in approximately 1 to 2 weeks to complete a clinical interview with her, and then to begin teaching coping skills as well as explore ways for reducing her stress.


DSM IV DIAGNOSES:  

AXIS I:  Conversion disorder (300.11).
AXIS II:  Diagnoses deferred.
AXIS III:  Seizure disorder.
AXIS IV:  Problems with primary support group, peer problems, and educational problems.
AXIS V:  Global assessment of functioning equals 60.

OPERATION PERFORMED: 
 Cervical epidural steroid injection C7-T1.


ANESTHESIA:
  Local and Versed 2 mg IV.


COMPLICATIONS:  
None.


DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  
The patient was placed in the seated position with the neck flexed the forehead was placed on a cervical rest.  The head and cervical spine were restrained.  The patient was monitored with a blood pressure cuff, EKG and pulse oximetry.  The skin was prepped and draped in sterile classical fashion.  Excess cleansing solution was removed from the skin.  Local anesthesia was injected at C7-T1.  An 18-gauge Tuohy needle was then placed in the epidural space with loss of resistance technique and a saline-filled syringe utilizing a midline intralaminar approach.

Once the epidural space was identified, a negative aspiration for heme or CSF was done.  This was followed by the injection of 6 cc of saline mixed with methyl prednisolone acetate 120 mg in aliquots of 2 cc.  Negative aspirations were done prior to each injection.  The needle was cleared with saline prior to its withdrawal.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any apparent difficulties or complications.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURES

The patient is a 61-year-old woman who presents with a history of biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma, right and left cheek.  She had no prior history of skin cancer.  She is status post bilateral cosmetic breast augmentation many years ago and the records are not available for this procedure.  She has noted progressive hardening and distortion of the implant.  She desires to have the implants removed, capsulectomy and replacement of implants.  She would like to go slightly smaller than her current size as she has ptosis going with a smaller implant combined with capsulectomy will result in worsening of her ptosis.  She may require a lift.  She is not consenting to lift due to the surgical scars.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

Significant for deep venous thrombosis and acid reflux.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY

Significant for appendectomy, colonoscopy and BAM.


MEDICATIONS

1.  Coumadin.  She stopped her Coumadin five days prior to the procedures.
2.  Lipitor
3.  Effexor.
4.  Klonopin.


ALLERGIES

None.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Negative for dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, chest pain, and phlebitis.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

VITAL SIGNS:  Height 5'8&quot;, weight 155 pounds.
FACE:  Examination of the face demonstrates basal cell carcinoma, right and left cheek.  No lesions are noted in the regional lymph node base and no mass is appreciated.
BREAST:  Examination of the breast demonstrates bilateral grade IV capsular contracture.  She has asymmetry in distortion of the breast.  No masses are appreciated in the breast or the axilla.  The implants appear to be subglandular.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.
EXTREMITIES:  Show full range of motion.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
SKIN:  Significant environmental actinic skin damage.

I recommended excision of basal cell cancers with frozen section control of the margin, closure will require local tissue flaps.  I recommended exchange of the implants with reaugmentation.  No final size is guaranteed or implied.  We will decrease the size of the implants based on the intraoperative findings as the size is not known.  Several options are available.  Sizer implants will be placed to best estimate postoperative size.  Ptosis will be worse following capsulectomy and going with a smaller implant.  She may require a lift in the future.  We have obtained preoperative clearance from the patient's cardiologist, Dr. K.  The patient has been taken off Coumadin for five days and will be placed back on Coumadin the day after the surgery.  The risk of deep venous thrombosis is discussed.  Other risk including bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, pain, scarring, hypertrophic scarring and poor cosmetic resolve, worsening of ptosis, exposure, extrusion, the rupture of the implants, numbness of the nipple-areolar complex, hematoma, need for additional surgery, recurrent capsular contracture and recurrence of the skin cancer was all discussed, which she understands and informed consent is obtained.


PROCEDURE IN DETAIL

After appropriate informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the preoperative holding area with **** input.  She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position.  Intravenous antibiotics were given.  TED hose and SCDs were placed.  After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin.  These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.

After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin.  They were tagged at the 12 o'clock position and sent for frozen section.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement.  Undermining was performed.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery.  Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl.  Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene.  Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made.  Dissection was carried down to the capsule.  It was extremely calcified.  Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed.  The implant was subglandular, the capsule was entered, implant was noted to be grossly intact; however, there was free silicone.  Implant was removed and noted to be ruptured.  No marking as to the size of the implant was found.

Capsulectomy was performed leaving a small portion in the axilla in the inframammary fold.  Pocket was modified to medialize the implant by placing 2-0 Prolene laterally in mattress sutures to restrict the pocket.  In identical fashion, capsulectomy was performed on the left.  Implant was noted to be grossly ruptured.  No marking was found for the size of the implant.  The entire content was weighed and found to be 350 grams.  Right side was weighed and noted to be 338 grams, although some silicone was lost in the transfer and most likely was identical 350 grams.  The implants appeared to be double lumen with the saline portion deflated.  Completion of the capsulectomy was performed on the left.

The pocket was again fashioned to improve symmetry with the right with Prolene.  Pockets were thoroughly irrigated.  Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery, checked for symmetry, which is determined to be excellent.  Several liters of normal saline were utilized to irrigate the pocket.  Hemostasis was determined to be excellent.  Drains were placed.  2-0 Vicryl sutures were preplaced. Pockets were checked for hemostasis, irrigated with normal saline, sizing was performed with placement of 275 cc implants.  She was placed in a sitting position.  This significantly worsened ptosis and for this reason, 325 cc implants were chosen.  She is placed back in a supine position.  Pockets were irrigated with antibiotic solution, 2-0 Vicryl sutures were preplaced and gloves were changed.  The patient was reprepped with Betadine, towels were changed.

These were soaked in antibiotic solution.  Gloves were changed, gowns were changed, the patient was reprepped, towels were changed and implants were placed.  The patient was placed in a sitting position.  Symmetry was excellent.  There was noted to be a decrease of volume of approximately 40 cc from the capsulectomy as well as the additional reduction of 25 cc.  Ptosis was slightly worse; however, excellent shape of the breast.  She was placed back in a supine position, preplaced 2-0 Vicryl sutures were tied; a second layer subcutaneous of 3-0 Vicryl was placed followed by a third of 4-0 Vicryl.  The skin was closed with a running 4-0 Prolene.  Drains were secured.  All sponge and needle counts were correct.  Dressing was applied.


COMPLICATIONS

None.


DISPOSITION

To recovery room.
